AB  - BACKGROUND: Snakebite envenoming remains a relevant public health problem in
      tropical and subtropical countries. In Ecuador, this is particularly true in an
      area of great diversity like the Amazon region. Nevertheless, there is scarce
      information about epidemiological and clinical characteristics of these accidents
      in this area. METHODS: This was a descriptive and retrospective study of
      snakebite cases treated at a tertiary hospital in the Napo Province, Ecuadorian
      Amazon, from 2015 to 2019. We collected sociodemographic and snakebite-related
      information, clinical aspects and the use of antivenom and antibiotics from
      medical records. RESULTS: Information from 133 snakebite accidents was reviewed
      in this time period. Reports of snakebite envenoming decreased over the years. In
      total, 67% of those bitten were from nearby indigenous communities, which were
      the most affected groups. When a species was identified, Bothrops atrox was
      responsible for the highest number of cases registered. Local clinical
      manifestations were more frequent than systemic signs, in keeping with the
      typical effects produced by bothropic venoms. Additionally, data showed that more
      antivenom vials were given than those suggested by the protocol of the Ecuadorian
      Ministry of Health, in proportion to the grade of severity. Finally, we
      identified a low incidence of adverse reactions with antivenom administration, as
      well as a frequent use of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The profile of snakebite
      accidents in the Napo Province is very similar to that described for other
      localities in the Amazon region of Ecuador and neighboring countries, with its
      challenges and limitations. Such aspects underlie the importance of establishing 
      a robust and science-based public health program to respond to this frequent, but
      neglected, tropical disease.

TI  - Clinical Performance of Three Commercial SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Tests for
      Community-Dwelling Individuals in a Tropical Setting.
PG  - 832235
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.832235 [doi]
AB  - During the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of Rapid Diagnosis
      Antigen Tests (RDAgTs) for SARS-CoV-2 detection has substantially increased as
      some of the brands available in the market were certified for clinical use by
      international regulatory agencies. RDAgTs are a fast and cheap tool for
      SARS-CoV-2 surveillance with great potential to improve testing capacities in
      middle- and low-income countries compared to the gold standard RT-qPCR. However, 
      as the clinical performance of RDAgTs has been shown to vary greatly between the 
      commercial brands available, evaluation studies are necessary. Moreover, the
      available evaluation has been done in high-income countries while SARS-CoV-2
      transmission is also actively happening in developing countries, many of which
      are located in tropical latitudes where cross-reactivity with other infectious
      agents is highly prevalent, which could compromise RDAgT specificity. Moreover,
      unreported mutations and/or new SARS-CoV-2 variants may compromise RDAgT
      sensitivity as genomic surveillance is limited in these settings. Here we
      describe a multicenter and manufacturer-independent evaluation of the clinical
      performance and analytical sensitivity of three different RDAgTs brands available
      in South America from three companies, Rapigen (South Korea), SD-Biosensor (South
      Korea), and Certest (Spain), compared to the gold standard RT-qPCR. A total
      number of 1,646 nasopharyngeal swabs from community-dwelling individuals were
      included in the study, and 379 of them were SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-qPCR. The
      overall sensitivity for each RDAgT was 79% (IC95%: 72 - 86.2), 64.2% (IC95%: 56.7
      - 71.6), and 45.8% (IC95%: 35.8 - 55.8) for SD-Biosensor, Certest, and Rapigen,
      respectively. The overall specificity for each RDAgT was 100%, 97.7% (IC95%: 96.8
      - 98.6), and 100% for SD-Biosensor, Certest, and Rapigen, respectively. However, 
      the limit of detection (LoD) to achieve a sensitivity over 90% was substantially 
      lower for Certest RDAgT (10(2) copies/uL) compared to SD-Biosensor (10(3)
      copies/uL) or Rapigen (10(6) copies/uL) RDAgTs, considering that the gold
      standard RT-qPCR method used in this study has a high sensitivity of 97.7% and
      low LoD of 5 copies/uL. Additionally, the Certest RDAgT also showed an improved
      sensitivity up to 79.7% (IC95%: 70.2 - 89.2) for symptomatic individuals.
      Finally, the slight reduction in specificity for Certest RDAgTs was only
      associated with one of the laboratories performing this study, pointing out the
      need for locally assessed evaluation for RDAgTs like this one carried out in
      Ecuador. In conclusion, two of the three the RDAgTs tested in this study are a
      fast, cheap, and point of care tool for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and reliable
      enough to detect SARS-CoV-2 infectious individuals.

TI  - First Report of Maize White Spot Disease Caused by Pantoea ananatis in China.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-01-22-0152-PDN [doi]
AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important crops in China. Since 2020, a
      new leaf spot disease has occurred in southwest China in areas such as Yunnan,
      Sichuan and Hubei provinces. Typical symptoms appeared after tasseling. The spots
      are scattered on the leaf surface, round to oval in shape with diameter range
      3-20 mm. Spots are initially water-soaked, gradually turning yellow or white. In 
      2021, diseased leaf samples with typical white spot were collected for pathogen
      isolation and identification in Qujing, Yunnan province. Four small pieces of
      leaf tissue (about 0.25 cm2 in area) were excised from the edge of the necrotic
      lesion of each plant, surface sterilized with 75% ethanol for 1 min, rinsed three
      times with sterile distilled water, and soaked in sterile distilled water for 5
      min. The solution was plated on Luria Broth medium (LB) plate (Shin et al. 2022) 
      . After incubation at 28 degrees C for 24 h, round, smooth-edged yellow colonies 
      appeared in the LB plate. The bacterium isolated was gram-negative, negative for 
      oxidase, positive for peroxidase, indole, citrate (Wells et al. 1987). Three
      strains (PA21QJ01, PA21QJ02 and PA21QJ03) showed identical colony morphology.
      PA21QJ01 was used for further molecular analyses. DNA was extracted from fresh
      colonies cultured in LB(Shin et al. 2022), and the fragments at the 16S rDNA,
      gyrB and rpoB loci were amplified using primers 27F/1492R (Galkiewicz and Kellogg
      2008), UP-1/UP-2r (Yamamoto and Harayama 1995) and rpoBCM81-F/rpoBCM32b-R (Brady 
      et al. 2008), respectively. The sequences of fragments of 16S rDNA, gyrB and rpoB
      from isolate PA21QJ01 were was deposited in GenBank (accession number:
      OM184301.1, OM302500, OM302499). A search for homologous sequences using BLAST
      resulted in 99.9, 99.6 and 99.8% identity of 16S rDNA, gyrB and rpoB,
      respectively, with sequences from the NN08200 of Pantoea ananatis (GenBank
      accession numbers: MK415050.1 for 16S rDNA, CP035034.1 for gyrB and CP035034.1.1 
      for rpoB). Above molecular results indicated that PA21QJ01 isolated from maize
      white spot is P. ananatis. Pathogenicity tests were performed on tasseled plants 
      of the suscptible maize variety Wugu1790. After culture in LB medium plate at 30 
      degrees C for 12 h, the bacterial solution was used for inoculation at a
      concentration of 1 x 108 CFU ml-1. After 7 days of inoculation, the leaves of the
      plants appeared water-soaked. After 10 days, white spot developed with brown
      margin. In contrast, the control plants remained healthy and symptomless. The
      same P. ananatis was reisolated in the inoculated maize plants, fulfilled Koch's 
      law. In the last decade, P. ananatis has been reported to cause maize white spot 
      in South Africa, Mexico, Poland, Argentina, Brazil (Sauer et al. 2015), and
      Ecuador (Toaza et al.2021). It has caused crop diseases with other crops, such as
      onion, rice, pineapple, melon, and sorghum, and others (Sauer et al. 2015). It
      caused leaf blight and leaf steak in rice in China (Yu et al. 2021). This is the 
      first report of maize white spot caused by P. ananatis in China. However, to our 
      knowledge, this is the first report of maize white spot disease in China.
      Attentions should be paid to screening for disease-resistant resources and
      breeding disease-resistant hybrids. Reference: Wells, J. M. et al. 1987. Int. J.

TI  - Evaluation of Selective Deltamethrin Application with Household and Community
      Awareness for the Control of Chagas Disease in Southern Ecuador.
PG  - 1421-1433
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac050 [doi]
AB  - Chagas disease is endemic in ~70% of Ecuador. Rhodnius ecuadoriensis and Triatoma
      carrioni (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) are the primary vectors of Chagas disease in
      Southern Ecuador. This study tested the effectiveness of selective deltamethrin
      application of Domiciliary Units (DUs) infested with triatomines, coupled with
      community education activities and a community-based surveillance system. Ten
      communities were selected in Loja Province, 466 DUs were examined, of these, 5.6%
      were infested with R. ecuadoriensis (Density [D] = 4 triatomines/DUs searched,
      Crowding [CR] = 71 triatomines/infested house, Colonization Index [CI] = 77%
      infested DUs with nymphs) and 8% with T. carrioni (D = 0.6, CR = 7, CI = 64%).
      Infested DUs were sprayed with deltamethrin. Subsequent visits were conducted at 
      6 and 12 mo after spraying. At each time point, new entomological searches were
      carried out in all DUs. All entomological indexes dropped significantly for the
      primary vector species one year after the initial intervention (R. ecuadoriensis:
      I = 2%, D = 0.1, CR = 7, CI = 100%; T. carrioni: I = 1.6%, D = 0.1, CR = 5.5, CI 
      = 50%). Fifteen min educational talks were conducted in every DUs and workshops
      for schoolchildren were organized. Community-based surveillance system was
      established. However, there is a high risk of DUs reinfestation, possibly from
      sylvatic habitats (especially of R. ecuadoriensis) and reinforcing educational
      and surveillance activities are necessary.

TI  - Phylogeography and evolutionary history of the Panamic Clingfish Gobiesox adustus
      in the Tropical Eastern Pacific.

AB  - The Panamic Clingfish Gobiesox adustus is widely distributed in the Tropical
      Eastern Pacific (TEP), from the central Gulf of California, Mexico to Ecuador,
      including the oceanic Revillagigedo Archipelago, and Isla del Coco. This
      cryptobenthic species is restricted to very shallow rocky-reef habitats. Here, we
      used one mitochondrial and three nuclear DNA markers from 155 individuals
      collected across the distribution range of the species in order to evaluate if
      geographically structured populations exist and to elucidate its evolutionary
      history. Phylogenetic analyses recovered a monophyletic group, with four
      well-supported, allopatric subgroups. Each subgroup corresponded to one of the
      following well-known biogeographic regions/provinces: 1) the Revillagigedo
      Archipelago, 2) the Cortez + Mexican provinces (Mexico), 3) the Panamic province 
      (from El Salvador to Ecuador), and 4) Isla del Coco. A molecular-clock analysis
      showed a mean date for the divergence between clade I (the Revillagigedos and
      Cortez + Mexican provinces) and clade II (Panamic province and Isla del Coco) in 
      the Pliocene, at ca. 5.33 Mya. Within clade I, the segregation between the
      Revillagigedos and Cortez + Mexican province populations was dated at ca. 1.18
      Mya, during the Pleistocene. Within clade II, the segregation between samples of 
      Isla del Coco and the Panamic province samples was dated at ca. 0.77 Mya, during 
      the Pleistocene. The species tree, Bayesian species delimitation tests (BPP and
      STACEY), the PhiST, AMOVA, and the substantial genetic distances that exist
      between those four subgroups, indicate that they are independent evolutionary
      units. These cladogenetic events seem to be related to habitat discontinuities,
      and oceanographic and geological processes that produce barriers to gene flow for
      G. adustus, effects of which are enhanced by the intrinsic ecological
      characteristics of this species.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of the RBD-Dimer-Based Covid-19 Vaccine ZF2001 in Adults.
PG  - 2097-2111
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2202261 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ZF2001 vaccine, which contains a dimeric form of the
      receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and
      aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant, was shown to be safe, with an acceptable
      side-effect profile, and immunogenic in adults in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. 
      METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3
      trial to investigate the efficacy and confirm the safety of ZF2001. The trial was
      performed at 31 clinical centers across Uzbekistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and
      Ecuador; an additional center in China was included in the safety analysis only. 
      Adult participants (>/=18 years of age) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
      receive a total of three 25-mug doses (30 days apart) of ZF2001 or placebo. The
      primary end point was the occurrence of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019
      (Covid-19), as confirmed on polymerase-chain-reaction assay, at least 7 days
      after receipt of the third dose. A key secondary efficacy end point was the
      occurrence of severe-to-critical Covid-19 (including Covid-19-related death) at
      least 7 days after receipt of the third dose. RESULTS: Between December 12, 2020,
      and December 15, 2021, a total of 28,873 participants received at least one dose 
      of ZF2001 or placebo and were included in the safety analysis; 25,193
      participants who had completed the three-dose regimen, for whom there were
      approximately 6 months of follow-up data, were included in the updated primary
      efficacy analysis that was conducted at the second data cutoff date of December
      15, 2021. In the updated analysis, primary end-point cases were reported in 158
      of 12,625 participants in the ZF2001 group and in 580 of 12,568 participants in
      the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 75.7% (95% confidence interval [CI],
      71.0 to 79.8). Severe-to-critical Covid-19 occurred in 6 participants in the
      ZF2001 group and in 43 in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 87.6% (95%
      CI, 70.6 to 95.7); Covid-19-related death occurred in 2 and 12 participants,
      respectively, for a vaccine efficacy of 86.5% (95% CI, 38.9 to 98.5). The
      incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was balanced in the two
      groups, and there were no vaccine-related deaths. Most adverse reactions (98.5%) 
      were of grade 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of adults, the ZF2001
      vaccine was shown to be safe and effective against symptomatic and
      severe-to-critical Covid-19 for at least 6 months after full vaccination. (Funded

TI  - First report of yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) in wheat
      (Triticum aestivum) in Paraguay.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-03-22-0482-PDN [doi]
AB  - Wheat yellow (stripe) rust caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici
      Eriks. (Pst) is an important disease worldwide (Chen 2005; Afzal et al., 2007;
      Hovmoller et al. 2011). In Latin America, the disease has been reported in
      Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and Uruguay (van
      Beuningen and Kohli, 1986; German et al., 2007). The disease was observed for the
      first time in Paraguay at Capitan Miranda (Itapua) (27 degrees 12'07.5888''S, 55 
      degrees 47'20.3640''W) in an environment with average minimum temperature below
      10 degrees C in July 2021 (coldest month). Symptoms were yellow rust pustules
      distributed linearly on the leaves of adult host plants (Fig. 1). Oval-shaped
      uredinia contained unicellular, yellow to orange, spherical urediniospores (28,
      82 x 26, 83 mum), within the range reported by Rioux et al. (2015). Black telia
      produced yellow to orange teliospores (64, 12 x 15, 46 mum), which were within
      the range reported by Chen et al. (2014). All susceptible wheat cultivars had up 
      to 100% disease severity. Ten- day-old seedlings of the susceptible cultivars
      were inoculated in a greenhouse using urediniospores collected from the field.
      Two weeks after inoculation, extensive sporulation was observed on the seedlings.
      For pathogen identification, DNA was extracted from wheat leaf segments
      containing urediniospores using the PureLink(R) Plant Total DNA Purification Kit 
      (Invitrogen). PCR and sequencing were carried out by Macrogen (Korea), using the 
      following species-specific primers: PSF (5`-GGATGTTGAGTGCTGCTGTAA-3`) / PSR
      (5`-TTGAGGTCTTAAGGTTAAAATTG-3`), which amplifies an internal transcribed spacer
      (ITS) region (Zhao et al. 2007); LidPs9 (TCGGTAAAACTGCACCAATACCT) / LidPs10
      (TCCCAACAGTCCCCTTCTGT), which amplifies a fragment of the RNA polymerase II gene 
      encoding the second largest subunit (rpb2); and LidPs11 (TTACGACATCTGCTTCCGCA) / 
      LisPs12 (TGCGATGTCAACTCTGGGAC) and LidPs13 (TACGACATCTGCTTCCGCAC) / LidPs14
      (GATTGCCCGGTATTGTTGGC), both pairs amplifying fragments of the beta-tubulin 1
      gene (tub1) (Kuzdralinski et al. 2017). The sequences obtained were OM631935,
      OM638432, OM718000, and OM718001 and were aligned using the GenBank BLAST tool
      (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), obtaining a 100% match with the
      following sequences: KC677574.1, KY411522.1, KY411533.1, and KY411542.1,
      respectively. Yellow-rust-infected leaf samples were collected from a field trial
      and sent to the Global Rust Reference Center (GRRC), Denmark. Simple sequence
      repeat (SSR) genotyping of samples from two different cultivars exhibited the
      genetic lineage PstS13 (www.wheatrust.org), which had previously been detected in
      South America (Carmona et al., 2019), thereby confirming the first report of
      wheat yellow rust in Paraguay. Considering that the Paraguayan wheat germplasm is
      highly susceptible to yellow rust, further studies are required to monitor
      potential spread and establishment of yellow rust in Paraguay and to explore
      potential sources of resistance to prevent future epidemics.

TI  - Revision of Neotropical Scythrididae moths and descriptions of 22 new species
      from Argentina, Chile, and Peru (Lepidoptera, Gelechioidea).
PG  - 19-104

AB  - The taxonomy of South American Scythrididae (Lepidoptera: Gelechioidea) is
      revised, based on external morphology, genitalia, male abdominal segment VIII,
      and DNA barcodes using genetic distances, BINs, and a tentative molecular
      phylogeny. Data include both historical and fresh specimens from Argentina,
      Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Peru. Thirty-four species are
      recognised as valid, and the fauna classified in three genera. Type specimens and
      morphology of all species are described and figured in detail. DNA barcode
      sequences of the COI gene were successful for 22 species, the average genetic
      divergence between species being 5.1%. A key to Neotropical Scythrididae species 
      is provided, based on the male genitalia and abdominal segment VIII, which show
      most and easily accessible interspecific differences. Our study revealed that the
      Scythridae fauna of South America is more or less completely unknown. As a
      result, 22 new species are described, increasing the number of South American
      Scythrididae species from 13 to 34. All new species are authored by Kari Nupponen
      (incertae sedis means the genus combination is uncertain and needs further
      research, country of the type locality is given in parentheses):
      Rhamphurasubdimota sp. nov. (Argentina), R.pozohondaensis sp. nov. (Argentina),
      R.spiniuncus sp. nov. (Argentina), R.angulisociella sp. nov. incertae sedis
      (Argentina), R.curvisociella sp. nov. incertae sedis (Argentina),
      R.tetrafasciella sp. nov. incertae sedis (Argentina), Landryiaankylosauroides sp.

      (Argentina), S.angustivalvella sp. nov. (Argentina), S.caimancitoensis sp. nov.
      (Argentina), S.lequetepequensis sp. nov. (Peru), S.sanfriscoensis sp. nov.
      (Argentina), S.tigrensis sp. nov. (Argentina), S.bicoloristrigella sp. nov.
      incertae sedis (Argentina), S.saldaitisi sp. nov. incertae sedis (Argentina),
      S.wikstromi sp. nov. incertae sedis (Argentina), S.andensis sp. nov. incertae
      sedis (Argentina), S.mendozaensis sp. nov. incertae sedis (Argentina). The
      following new combinations are proposed: Scythrisdepressa Meyrick, 1931 and
      Scythrisdimota Meyrick, 1931 are transferred from Scythris Hubner, 1825 to
      Rhamphura Landry, 1991 comb. nov. Three species classified in Scythris earlier
      are now classified as Scythris (incertae sedis): Scythrisdividua Meyrick, 1916,
      S.medullata Meyrick, 1916 and S.notorrhoa Meyrick, 1921. The taxon
      Syntetrernisneocompsa Meyrick, 1933, recently classified in Scythrididae:
      Scythris, is excluded from Scythrididae and it is now classified in
      Cosmopterigidae incertae sedis.

TI  - Description of a new minute frog of the genus Pristimantis (Anura:
      Strabomantidae) from Cordillera del Condor, Ecuador.
PG  - 351-372
LID - 10.11646/zootaxa.5072.4.3 [doi]
AB  - We describe a new species of Pristimantis from southern Ecuador, province of
      Zamora Chinchipe. The new species is closely related to an undescribed species of
      Pristimantis from Reserva Tapichalaca, Ecuador and with species of a clade
      historically assigned to the P. unistrigatus species group, such as P. parvillus,
      P. luteolateralis, P. walkeri, among others. The new species of Pristimantis is a
      miniaturized new frog (females 17.11.1 mm; males 13.20.9 mm), characterized by
      the presence of -shaped scapular folds, with two subconical tubercles on the
      medial and posterior regions of folds; tympanic membrane and tympanic annulus
      present but not externally visible; a prominent rostral papilla present; upper
      eyelid with one elongated conical tubercle; a conical tubercle on heels; groin
      with orange or yellow spots. The new species of Pristimantis is distributed in a 
      restricted area in the Cordillera del Condor, a highly-diverse mountain range
      threatened by multiple anthropogenic activities. We recommend assigning the new
      species to the Endangered IUCN threatened category because it is only known from 
      three nearby localities within mining concessions.

TI  - Taxonomic changes suggested by the genomic analysis of Hesperiidae (Lepidoptera).
LID - 1409 [pii]
AB  - Our expanded efforts in genomic sequencing to cover additional skipper butterfly

      specimens, call for taxonomic changes to restore monophyly and correct
      misidentifications by moving taxa between genera and proposing new names.

      Grishin, new species (type locality in Peru: Cuzco), and Metiscus goth Grishin,
      new species (type locality in Costa Rica). Lectotypes are designated for the
      following 17 taxa: Telegonus gildo Mabille, 1888, Netrocoryne damias Plotz, 1882,
      Telegonus erythras Mabille, 1888, Telegonus galesus Mabille, 1888, Eudamus
      cretellus Herrich-Schaffer, 1869, Leucochitonea chaeremon Mabille, 1891,
      Antigonus aura Plotz, 1884, Pamphila voranus Mabille, 1891, Hesperia pupillus
      Plotz, 1882, Cobalus lumina Herrich-Schaffer, 1869, Cobalus stigmula Mabille,
      1891, Megistias isus Godman, 1900, Cobalopsis latonia Schaus, 1913, Pamphila
      nubila Mabille, 1891, Metiscus atheas Godman, 1900, Mnasalcas amatala Schaus,
      1902, and Hesperia ina Plotz, 1882. The lectotype of Hesperia infuscata Plotz,
      1882 is invalid because it does not agree with the original description and
      illustration by Plotz, is not from the locality listed in the original
      description, and therefore is not a syntype. Neotypes are designated for the
      following five taxa: Telegonus corentinus Plotz, 1882, Hesperia dido Plotz, 1882,
      Hesperia distigma Plotz, 1882, Hesperia infuscata Plotz, 1882, and Hesperia
      pruinosa Plotz, 1882. As a result, the following five taxa are junior objective
      synonyms: Telegonus diophorus Moschler, 1883 of Telegonus corentinus Plotz, 1882,
      Pamphila puxillius Mabille, 1891 of Hesperia pupillus Plotz, 1882, Cobalus
      stigmula Mabille, 1891 of Hesperia distigma Plotz, 1882, Mnasalcas amatala
      Schaus, 1902 of Hesperia infuscata Plotz, 1882, and Hesperia pruinosa Plotz, 1882
      of Hesperia uza Hewitson, 1877. Morys valerius valda Evans, 1955 is fixed as the 
      type species of Morys Godman, 1900, and Pamphila compta Butler, 1877 is
      reaffirmed as the type species of Euroto Godman, 1900. Furthermore, the following
      taxonomic changes are suggested. Prosopalpus Holland, 1896, Lepella Evans, 1937, 
      and Creteus de Niceville, 1895 are placed in Aeromachini Tutt, 1906. Triskelionia
      Larsen and Congdon, 2011 is transferred from Celaenorrhinini Swinhoe, 1912 to
      Tagiadini Mabille, 1878. Kobelana Larsen and Collins, 2013 is transferred from
      Tagiadini Mabille, 1878 to Celaenorrhinini Swinhoe, 1912. The following nine
      genus-group names are resurrected from synonymy and treated as valid genera:
      Abaratha Moore, 1881 (not in Caprona Wallengren, 1857), Bibla Mabille, 1904 (not 
      in Taractrocera Butler, 1870), Kerana Distant, 1886 and Tamela Swinhoe, 1913 (not
      in Ancistroides Butler, 1874), Metrocles Godman, 1900 (not in Metron Godman,
      1900), Alerema Hayward, 1942 (not in Tigasis Godman, 1900), Metiscus Godman, 1900
      (not in Enosis Mabille, 1889), Vistigma Hayward, 1939 (not in Phlebodes Hubner,
      [1819]), and Mnasalcas Godman, 1900 (not in Mnasitheus Godman, 1900). The
      genus-group names Daimio Murray, 1875 and Pterygospidea Wallengren, 1857 are
      resurrected from synonymy and treated as valid subgenera of Tagiades Hubner,
      [1819]. We confirm Apallaga Strand, 1911 as a valid genus. The following 24
      genera are placed as subgenera, new status: Pseudonascus Austin, 2008 of Nascus
      Watson, 1893; Albiphasma Huang, Chiba, Wang and Fan, 2016 of Pintara Evans, 1932;

      1939 of Mnasicles Godman, 1901; Repens Evans, 1955 of Eprius Godman, 1901; Morys 
      Godman, 1900 of Lerema Scudder, 1872; Enosis Mabille, 1889 of Lychnuchus Hubner, 
      [1831]; Penicula Evans, 1955 of Vistigma Hayward, 1939; Mnasinous Godman, 1900 of
      Methionopsis Godman, 1901; and Moeros Evans, 1955, Argon Evans, 1955, and Synale

LID - 10.1177/21501319221087866 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have attempted to clarify the role of social
      determinants of health (SDH) on nutritional status of older adults, but results
      are inconsistent due to differences in SDH assessments at different levels of
      population development. In this study, we assessed this association in
      community-dwelling older adults living in rural Ecuador. Methods: SDH were
      measured by the Gijon's Social-Familial Evaluation Scale (SFES) and nutritional
      status by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA((R))). Multivariate logistic
      regression models were fitted to assess the association between SDH components
      and nutritional status. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) and a
      generalized linear model were used to evaluate the potential non-linearity of the
      association between the Gijon's SFES and MNA((R)) scores. RESULTS: A total of 295
      individuals (mean age: 72.1 +/- 7.6 years; 58% women) were enrolled. There was an
      inverse association between the total Gijon's SFES and nutritional status (OR:
      0.75; 95% C.I.: 0.65-0.86; P < .001). Three of five components of the Gijon's
      SFES (family situation, social relationships, and support networks) were
      inversely associated with nutritional status in multivariate logistic regression 
      models. A LOWESS plot, together with a generalized linear model, showed an
      inverse linear relationship between the continuous Gijon's SFES and MNA((R))
      scores. One standard deviation of increase in the continuous Gijon's SFES score
      (2.39 points) decreased the MNA((R)) score by 0.78 points. CONCLUSION: Study
      results show a significant inverse association between high social risk and a
      good nutritional status. Components of the Gijon's SFES measuring social
      isolation are responsible for this association.

LID - 10.1016/j.gaceta.2021.12.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the association between mobility restriction and mental
      health outcomes among Ecuadorian young adults. METHOD: The present is a
      cross-sectional study that included a non-probabilistic sample of mostly highly
      educated young adults. Socio-demographic and mental health data were collected
      through an online survey, between May and June 2020, when confinement was
      mandatory in Ecuador. Data on mobility was extracted from Google Community
      Mobility Reports. Four aspects of the participants' mental health were evaluated:
      eating behavior (emotional eating), depression, sleep quality and sense of
      coherence as a proxy of resilience, using previously validated instruments. Data 
      were analyzed using multiple linear regression models in R. RESULTS: Sample
      included 8426 young adults, with a mean age of 22.85 (standard deviation: 4.43), 
      most of whom were women (n=5943, 70.53%). During mandatory confinement, in
      Ecuador mobility in general was reduced by nearly 50% in comparison to
      January/February, 2020. Less healthy eating behavior, depression, worse sleep
      quality and lower sense of coherence were associated with higher mobility
      restriction to workplaces and groceries/pharmacies. Women and youngsters more
      often showed depression, less healthy eating behavior, worse quality of sleep and
      lower sense of coherence in comparison with men and older respondents.
      CONCLUSIONS: Mobility restrictions during COVID-19 pandemic were associated with 
      worse self-reported mental health in a sample of young highly-educated Ecuadorian
      adults. Women and youngsters were the most affected. Our findings highlight the
      need of implementing health promotion measures directed to ameliorate the effects
      of confinement on mental health, focusing on women and youngsters.

TI  - Do COVID-19 Worries, Resilience and Emotional Distress &amp;nbsp;Influence Life
      Satisfaction? Outcomes in Adolescents in Ecuador during the Pandemic: SEM vs.
      QCA.
LID - 439 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/children9030439 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 and the measures adopted have been a problem for society at all levels. 
      The aim of the study was to analyze the main predictors of life satisfaction
      among adolescents in Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 902 
      adolescents from Ecuador aged between 12 and 18 years (M = 15.30; SD = 1.28).
      Variables such as life satisfaction, resilience, emotional symptomatology, and
      worries about COVID-19 were assessed. Two statistical methodologies were compared
      (structural equation models (SEM) and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA)) to 
      analyze the possible influence of worries about COVID-19, resilience and
      emotional symptomatology towards life satisfaction. The results indicated that in
      both models, worries about COVID-19 were negatively related to life satisfaction.
      However, having a greater worry, specifically for physical health issues, was
      associated with better life satisfaction. SEM models indicate that depression is 
      negatively related to life satisfaction. In QCA models, high levels of life
      satisfaction are explained by low levels of anxiety and depression. Thus,
      resilience seems to play a mediating role in life satisfaction, although this is 
      only true for the depression variable. It is necessary to detect signs of risk in
      this population and strengthen resilience in them as elements that can facilitate
      their adequate coping with their adverse situation.

AB  - Much has yet to be learned of the spatial patterning of pre-Columbian people
      across the Tropical Andes. Using compiled archaeological data and a suite of
      environmental variables, we generate an ensemble species distribution model (SDM)
      that incorporates general additive models, random forest models and Maxent models
      to reconstruct spatial patterns of pre-Columbian people that inhabited the
      Tropical Andes east of the continental divide, within the modern countries of
      Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador. Within this region, here referred to as the eastern
      Andean flank, elevation, mean annual cloud frequency, distance to rivers and
      precipitation of the driest quarter are the environmental variables most closely 
      related to human occupancy. Our model indicates that 11.04% of our study area (65
      368 km(2)) was likely occupied by pre-Columbian people. Our model shows that 30
      of 351 forest inventory plots, which are used to generate ecological
      understanding of Andean ecosystems, were likely occupied in the pre-Columbian
      period. In previously occupied sites, successional trajectories may still be
      shaping forest dynamics, and those forests may still be recovering from the
      ecological legacy of pre-Columbian impacts. Our ensemble SDM links palaeo- and
      neo-ecology and can also be used to guide both future archaeological and
      ecological studies. This article is part of the theme issue 'Tropical forests in 
      the deep human past'.

TI  - A New Essential Oil from the Leaves of the Endemic Andean Species Gynoxys
      miniphylla Cuatrec. (Asteraceae): Chemical and Enantioselective Analyses.
LID - 398 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11030398 [doi]
AB  - A previously uninvestigated essential oil (EO) was distilled from Gynoxys
      miniphylla Cuatrec. (Asteraceae) and submitted to chemical and enantioselective
      analyses. The qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted by GC-MS and
      GC-FID, over two orthogonal columns (5%-phenyl-methylpolysiloxane and
      polyethylene glycol stationary phases). Major constituents (>/=2%) were, on both 
      columns, respectively, as follows: alpha-phellandrene (16.1-17.2%), alpha-pinene 
      (14.0-15.0%), germacrene D (13.3-14.8%), trans-myrtanol acetate (8.80%),
      delta-cadinene (4.2-4.6%), beta-phellandrene (3.3-2.8%), (E)-beta-caryophyllene
      (3.1-2.0%), o-cymene (2.4%), alpha-cadinol (2.3-2.6%), and alpha-humulene
      (1.7-2.0%). All the quantified compounds corresponded to 93.5-97.3% by weight of 
      the whole essential oil, with monoterpenes counting for 53.8-55.6% of the total, 
      and sesquiterpenes for 38.5-41.4%. For what concerns the enantioselective
      analyses, the chiral components were investigated through a
      beta-cyclodextrin-based enantioselective column
      (2,3-diethyl-6-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-beta-cyclodextrin). A total of six chiral 
      metabolites were analysed and the respective enantiomeric excess calculated as
      follows: (1S,5S)-(-)-alpha-pinene (98.2%), (1S,5S)-(-)-beta-pinene (11.9%),
      (1R,5R)-(+)-sabinene (14.0%), (R)-(-)-alpha-phellandrene (100.0%),
      (R)-(-)-beta-phellandrene (100.0%), and (S)-(-)-germacrene D (95.5%). According
      to the chemical composition and enantiomeric distribution of major compounds,
      this EO can be considered promising as a cholinergic, antiviral and, probably,
      analgesic product.

TI  - Lay causal beliefs about PTSD and cultural correlates in five countries.
PG  - 2029333
LID - 10.1080/20008198.2022.2029333 [doi]
AB  - Background: To date, cultural clinical research has primarily focused on
      differences between ethnic groups when investigating causal beliefs about mental 
      disorders. While individual as well as contextual factors are considered
      important for gaining a better understanding of cultural influences, research on 
      causal beliefs about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cultural
      correlates in laypersons is scarce. Objective: This study aimed at gain a better 
      understanding of the association between causal beliefs about PTSD and cultural
      aspects, as well as other contextual and individual correlates of causal beliefs.
      Method: We conducted a cross-sectional, vignette-based online survey with 737
      laypersons from Mexico, Ecuador, Germany, Greece, and Russia. Participants
      completed the illness perception questionnaire revised (IPQ-R) and reported
      several cultural and sociodemographic (e.g. country of residence, gender,
      personal values) as well as mental health-related variables (e.g. PTSD symptoms, 
      previous seeking of help). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify 
      subgroups of individuals expressing similar causal beliefs for PTSD. Multinomial 
      logistic regression was used to analyse covariates of class membership. Results: 
      LCA resulted in a three-class solution of casual beliefs: a traumatic
      event-focused class (41.1%); an intrapersonal causes class (40.1%); and a
      multiple causes class (18.0%). Multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed 
      country of residence, gender, personal value of security, PTSD symptoms, and
      mental health literacy as significant covariates of class membership.
      Conclusions: Integrating a more diverse concept of culture into cultural clinical
      research can be a valuable addition to group comparisons based on nationality or 
      ethnicity. Cultural clinical research needs to move towards a more integrated
      approach that accounts for the complexity of culture. Including additional
      contextual and sociodemographic factors can help to reach a more accurate
      understanding of the cultural influences on the development of causal beliefs and
      mental health.

TI  - Population genomics and geographic dispersal in Chagas disease vectors: Landscape
      drivers and evidence of possible adaptation to the domestic setting.
PG  - e1010019
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1010019 [doi]
AB  - Accurate prediction of vectors dispersal, as well as identification of
      adaptations that allow blood-feeding vectors to thrive in built environments, are
      a basis for effective disease control. Here we adopted a landscape genomics
      approach to assay gene flow, possible local adaptation, and drivers of population
      structure in Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, an important vector of Chagas disease. We
      used a reduced-representation sequencing technique (2b-RADseq) to obtain 2,552
      SNP markers across 272 R. ecuadoriensis samples from 25 collection sites in
      southern Ecuador. Evidence of high and directional gene flow between seven wild
      and domestic population pairs across our study site indicates insecticide-based
      control will be hindered by repeated re-infestation of houses from the forest.
      Preliminary genome scans across multiple population pairs revealed shared outlier
      loci potentially consistent with local adaptation to the domestic setting, which 
      we mapped to genes involved with embryogenesis and saliva production. Landscape
      genomic models showed elevation is a key barrier to R. ecuadoriensis dispersal.
      Together our results shed early light on the genomic adaptation in triatomine
      vectors and facilitate vector control by predicting that spatially-targeted,
      proactive interventions would be more efficacious than current, reactive
      approaches.

TI  - Acaricidal Efficacy of Plants from Ecuador, Ambrosia peruviana (Asteraceae) and
      Lepechinia mutica (Lamiaceae) against Larvae and Engorged Adult Females of the
      Common Cattle Tick, Rhipicephalus microplus.
LID - 23 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9010023 [doi]
AB  - Control measures against common cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus are of the
      upmost importance because of considerable, deleterious impact on a farm's
      economy. Due to resistance phenomena to synthetic acaricides being a constraint
      in affected farms, the search for plant derivatives as acaricides has increased
      dramatically in recent years. In this work, essential oils obtained from two
      Ecuadorian plants, Ambrosia peruviana and Lepechinia mutica (EOAp, EOLm),
      traditionally used as insecticides in indigenous communities, were studied on
      larvae and engorged females at the parasitic stages of R. microplus. Larvae and
      females were treated with five (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.50 and 1%) and six
      concentrations (0.125, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2 and 4%), respectively, of each EOsAp/Lm. 
      A 98-99% larval mortality was achieved with 0.5% of both EOsAp/Lm. EOAp inhibited
      oviposition and egg hatching up to 82% and 80%, respectively, and had an overall 
      efficacy of 93.12%. Efficacy of EOLm was 72.84%, due to the low influence of EOLm
      on reproductive parameters. By steam distillation and GC-MS analysis,
      gamma-Curcumene was identified as the main constituent (52.02%) in the EOAp and
      Shyobunol (10.80%) in EOLm. The results suggest that major components of both
      essential oils should be further studied as promissory acaricides against R.
      microplus.

TI  - Detection of Babesia spp. in High Altitude Cattle in Ecuador, Possible Evidence
      of the Adaptation of Vectors and Diseases to New Climatic Conditions.
LID - 1593 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens10121593 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Babesia species are intraerythrocytic protozoa, distributed in
      tropical and subtropical areas of the world, causing anemic diseases in many
      animals, including cattle. This disease, called babesisosis, is transmitted from 
      one animal to another through ticks (Tick Borne-Disease or TBD). On the other
      hand, Ecuador has a tropical climate that allows the development of the vector
      Rhipicephalus microplus, and therefore favors the transmission of Babesia spp. in
      cattle. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We determined the presence of Babesia
      spp. by PCR using 18s ribosomal gene as target (18s PCR) in 20 farms in the area 
      of El Carmen (zone below 300 m above sea level) and 1 farm in Quito (2469
      m.a.s.l.). In addition, we analyzed parameters such as age, sex, and packed cell 
      volume (PCV) as explanatory variable associated with the disease. RESULTS: The
      18s PCR test showed that 18.94% (14.77% Babesia bovis and 4.17% Babesia bigemina)
      and 20.28% (14.69% B. bovis and 5.59% B. bigemina) of the cattle were positive
      for Babesia spp in farms sampled in El Carmen and in Quito, respectively. Age
      influenced the presence of animals positive for Babesia spp., but sex and PCV did
      not. The phylogenetic analysis of sequences showed 4 isolates of B. bovis and 3
      isolates of B. bigemina in the 2 study zones, with similarities between 99.73 and
      100% with other sequences. One B. bovis isolate was similar in the zone of El
      Carmen and Quito. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: This work is the first molecular
      characterization of B. bigemina and B. bovis in Ecuador, and it is also the first
      evidence of Babesia spp. in cattle in the area of Quito at an altitude of 2469
      m.a.s.l., being the highest altitude reported for animals with babesiosis and for
      the tick R. microplus. Climatic factors as well as mobility of tick-carrying
      animals without any control allow the presence of Babesiosis outbreaks in new
      geographical areas.

TI  - Relationship between self-care activities, stress and well-being during COVID-19 
      lockdown: a cross-cultural mediation model.
PG  - e048469
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048469 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the mediation role of self-care between stress and
      psychological well-being in the general population of four countries and to
      assess the impact of sociodemographic variables on this relationship. DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional, online survey. PARTICIPANTS: A stratified sample of confined
      general population (N=1082) from four Ibero-American countries-Chile (n=261),
      Colombia (n=268), Ecuador (n=282) and Spain (n=271)-balanced by age and gender.
      PRIMARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: Sociodemographic information (age, gender, country,
      education and income level), information related to COVID-19 lockdown (number of 
      days in quarantine, number of people with whom the individuals live,
      absence/presence of adults and minors in charge and attitude towards the search
      of information related to COVID-19), Perceived Stress Scale-10, Ryff's
      Psychological Well-Being Scale-29 and Self-Care Activities Screening Scale-14.
      RESULTS: Self-care partially mediates the relationship between stress and
      well-being during COVID-19 confinement in the general population in the total
      sample (F (3,1078)=370.01, p<0.001, R(2)=0.507) and in each country. On the other
      hand, among the evaluated sociodemographic variables, only age affects this
      relationship. CONCLUSION: The results have broad implications for public health, 
      highlighting the importance of promoting people's active role in their own care
      and health behaviour to improve psychological well-being if stress management and
      social determinants of health are jointly addressed first. The present study
      provides the first transnational evidence from the earlier stages of the COVID-19
      lockdown, showing that the higher perception of stress, the less self-care
      activities are adopted, and in turn the lower the beneficial effects on
      well-being.

TI  - Chiasmatic lesions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging during the first
      event of optic neuritis in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder
      and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-associated disease in a Latin American
      cohort.
PG  - 802-809
LID - 10.1111/ene.15178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Optic neuritis (ON) is often the initial symptom of
      neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte
      glycoprotein-associated disease (MOGAD). We aimed to compare the frequency and
      pattern of chiasmatic lesions in MOGAD-related ON (MOGAD-ON) and NMOSD-related ON
      (NMOSD-ON) using conventional brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) in
      Latin America (LATAM). METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and brain MRI
      (</=30 days from ON onset) of patients with a first event of MOGAD-ON and
      NMOSD-ON. Patients from Argentina (n = 72), Chile (n = 21), Ecuador (n = 31),
      Brazil (n = 30), Venezuela (n = 10) and Mexico (n = 82) were included. Antibody
      status was tested using a cell-based assay. Demographic, clinical, imaging and
      prognostic (as measured by the Visual Functional System Score [VFSS] of the
      Expanded Disability Status Scale) data were compared. RESULTS: A total of 246
      patients (208 NMOSD and 38 MOGAD) were included. No differences were found in
      gender and ethnicity between the groups. We observed chiasmatic lesions in 66/208
      (31.7%) NMOSD-ON and in 5/38 (13.1%) MOGAD-ON patients (p = 0.01). Of these
      patients with chiasmatic lesions, 54/66 (81.8%) and 4/5 had associated
      longitudinally extensive optic nerve lesions, 45/66 (68%) and 4/5 had bilateral
      lesions, and 31/66 (47%) and 4/5 showed gadolinium-enhancing chiasmatic lesions, 
      respectively. A positive correlation was observed between VFSS and presence of
      bilateral (r = 0,28, p < 0.0001), chiasmatic (r = 0.27, p = 0.0001) and
      longitudinally extensive lesions (r = 0,25, p = 0.0009) in the NMOSD-ON group,
      but no correlations were observed in the MOGAD-ON group. CONCLUSIONS: Chiasmatic 
      lesions were significantly more common in NMOSD than in MOGAD during an ON attack
      in this LATAM cohort. Further studies are needed to assess the generalizability
      of these results.

TI  - Effect of altitude on COVID-19 mortality in Ecuador: an ecological study.
PG  - 2079
LID - 10.1186/s12889-021-12162-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has claimed nearly 900,000 lives
      worldwide and infected more than 27 million people. Researchers worldwide are
      studying ways to decrease SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 related deaths.
      Several studies found altitude having a negative association with both COVID-19
      incidence and deaths. Ecuadorian data was used to explore the relationship
      between altitude and COVID-19. METHODS: This is an ecological study examining
      province-level data. To explore a relationship between altitude and COVID-19,
      this study utilized publicly available COVID-19 data and population statistics.
      ANOVA, correlation statistics, and a multivariate linear model explored the
      relationship between different Ecuadorian altitudes against incidence, mortality,
      and case-fatality rates. Population statistics attributed to COVID-19 were
      included in the linear model to control for confounding factors. RESULTS:
      Statistically significant differences were observed in the regions of Amazonica, 
      Sierra, Costa of Ecuador for incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates,
      suggesting an association between altitude and SARS-CoV-2 transmission and
      COVID-19 disease severity (p-value </=0.05). In univariate analysis, altitude had
      a negative association to mortality rate with a 1-unit change in altitude
      resulting in the decrease of 0.006 units in mortality rate (p-value = 0.03). The 
      multiple linear models adjusted for population statistics showed a statistically 
      significant negative association of altitude with mortality rate (p-value = 0.01)
      with a 1-unit change in altitude resulting in the decrease in mortality rate by
      0.015 units. Overall, the model helped in explaining 50% (R(2) = 0.4962) of the
      variance in mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Altitude may have an effect on COVID-19
      mortality rates. However, based on our model and R(2) value, the relationship
      between our variables of interest and COVID-19 mortality may be nonlinear. More
      research is needed to understand why altitude may have a protective effect
      against COVID-19 mortality and how this may be applicable in a clinical setting.

AB  - In the current situation of sanitary emergencies, humanitarian organizations and 
      their volunteers are playing an important role in the coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) pandemic. A study is proposed that includes a network of volunteers
      who perform humanitarian activities during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess
      anxiety, perceived risk, and response behaviors and to explore their relationship
      with sociodemographic variables. For data collection, an online questionnaire was
      developed through the Google Forms(R) platform, where the perceived risk,
      anxiety, and behavioral responses of the general population to the Influenza A
      (H1N1) pandemic were assessed. The survey presented is a modified version of that
      survey adapted for COVID-19. This adaptation was endorsed by an experts committee
      made up of the health chief of the Ecuadorian Red Cross, the focus point of
      operations from the International Federation of the Red Cross in Ecuador, and a
      member from the Health Unit of the Americas Regional Office of the International 
      Federation of the Red Cross. A significant relationship has been shown between
      the job situation and perceived risk and anxiety, being the staff who worked full
      time away from home, which was exposed to greater risk and anxiety. Both
      perceived risk and perceived anxiety are very high (according to a 5-point Likert
      scale). Knowing these data from this first-line personnel will allow adopting
      measures that could be beneficial for stress management and, therefore,
      contribute to the well-being and support of these humanitarian and volunteer
      organizations in the worldwide response to COVID-1 9.

TI  - Multi-predictor mapping of soil organic carbon in the alpine tundra: a case study
      for the central Ecuadorian paramo.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1186/s13021-021-00195-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soil organic carbon (SOC) affects essential biological, biochemical, 
      and physical soil functions such as nutrient cycling, water retention, water
      distribution, and soil structure stability. The Andean paramo known as such a
      high carbon and water storage capacity ecosystem is a complex, heterogeneous and 
      remote ecosystem complicating field studies to collect SOC data. Here, we propose
      a multi-predictor remote quantification of SOC using Random Forest Regression to 
      map SOC stock in the herbaceous paramo of the Chimborazo province, Ecuador.
      RESULTS: Spectral indices derived from the Landsat-8 (L8) sensors, OLI and TIRS, 
      topographic, geological, soil taxonomy and climate variables were used in
      combination with 500 in situ SOC sampling data for training and calibrating a
      suitable predictive SOC model. The final predictive model selected uses nine
      predictors with a RMSE of 1.72% and a R(2) of 0.82 for SOC expressed in weight %,
      a RMSE of 25.8 Mg/ha and a R(2) of 0.77 for the model in units of Mg/ha.
      Satellite-derived indices such as VARIG, SLP, NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, EVI2, WDRVI,
      NDSI, NDMI, NBR and NBR2 were not found to be strong SOC predictors. Relevant
      predictors instead were in order of importance: geological unit, soil taxonomy,
      precipitation, elevation, orientation, slope length and steepness (LS Factor),
      Bare Soil Index (BI), average annual temperature and TOA Brightness Temperature. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Variables such as the BI index derived from satellite images and the
      LS factor from the DEM increase the SOC mapping accuracy. The mapping results
      show that over 57% of the study area contains high concentrations of SOC, between
      150 and 205 Mg/ha, positioning the herbaceous paramo as an ecosystem of global
      importance. The results obtained with this study can be used to extent the SOC
      mapping in the whole herbaceous ecosystem of Ecuador offering an efficient and
      accurate methodology without the need for intensive in situ sampling.

      During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ecuador].

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
      the world has faced a pandemic with consequences at all levels. In many
      countries, the health systems collapsed and healthcare professionals had to be on
      the front line of this crisis. The adverse effects on the mental health of
      healthcare professionals have been widely reported. This research focuses on
      identifying the main factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes.
      METHODS: Descriptive, cross-sectional study based on surveys, applying the PHQ-9,
      GAD-7, ISI and EIE-R tests to healthcare professionals from Ecuador during the
      COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 1,028 participants, distributed in: 557 physicians
      (54.18%), 349 nurses (33.94%), 29 laboratory workers (2.82%), 27 paramedics
      (2.62%), 52 psychologists (5.05%) and 14 respiratory therapists (1.36%), from 16 
      of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. Of these, 27.3% presented symptoms of depression,
      39.2% anxiety symptoms, 16.3% insomnia and 43.8% symptoms of PTSD, with the 4
      types of symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The most relevant associated
      factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (OR = 2.18 for
      depressive symptoms and OR = 2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor
      (OR = 1.52 for depressive symptoms and OR = 1.57 for insomnia), perception of not
      having the proper protective equipment (OR = 1.71 for symptoms of depression and 
      OR = 1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (OR = 1.39 for anxiety).
      CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition
      that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated 
      factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher
      number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate 
      doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are
      primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as
      being a resident physician and self-perception of safety. Further studies are
      required as the pandemic evolves.

AB  - Marine species that are widely distributed in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) 
      has served as a model for studying biogeographic patterns resulting from the
      effects of intraregional habitat discontinuities and oceanographic processes on
      the diversification and evolution of cryptobenthic reef fishes. Tomicodon
      petersii, a clingfish (Gobiesocidae) endemic to the TEP, is found on very shallow
      rocky reefs from central Mexico to northern Peru, and in the Cocos and Galapagos 
      islands. We evaluated the effect of likely biogeographic barriers in different
      parts of the TEP on the diversification process of this species. We used one
      mitochondrial and three nuclear DNA markers from 112 individuals collected across
      the distribution range of T. petersii. Our phylogenetic results showed the
      samples constituted a monophyletic group, with three well-supported, allopatric
      subgroups: in the Mexican province, the Panamic province (from El Salvador to
      Ecuador), and the Galapagos Islands. The split between the Mexican and more
      southerly clades was estimated to occur at the end of the Miocene ca. 5.74 Mya,
      and the subsequent cladogenetic event separating the Galapagos population from
      the Panamic population at the junction of the Pliocene and Pleistocene, ca. 2.85 
      Mya. The species tree, Bayesian species delimitation tests (BPP), STACEY, and
      substantial genetic distances separating these three populations indicate that
      these three independent evolutionary units likely include two unnamed species.
      The cladogenetic events that promoted the formation of those genetically
      differentiated groups are consistent with disruptive effects on gene flow of
      habitat discontinuities and oceanographic processes along the mainland shoreline 
      in the TEP and of ocean-island isolation, in conjunction with the species
      intrinsic life-history characteristics.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
      the world has faced a pandemic with consequences at all levels. In many
      countries, the health systems collapsed and healthcare professionals had to be on
      the front line of this crisis. The adverse effects on the mental health of
      healthcare professionals have been widely reported. This research focuses on
      identifying the main factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes.
      METHODS: Descriptive, cross-sectional study based on surveys, applying the PHQ-9,
      GAD-7, ISI and EIE-R tests to healthcare professionals from Ecuador during the
      COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 1028 participants, distributed in: 557 physicians
      (54.18%), 349 nurses (33.94%), 29 laboratory workers (2.82%), 27 paramedics
      (2.62%), 52 psychologists (5.05%) and 14 respiratory therapists (1.36%), from 16 
      of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. Of these, 27.3% presented symptoms of depression,
      39.2% anxiety symptoms, 16.3% insomnia and 43.8% symptoms of PTSD, with the 4
      types of symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The most relevant associated
      factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (OR=2.18 for
      depressive symptoms and OR=2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor
      (OR=1.52 for depressive symptoms and OR=1.57 for insomnia), perception of not
      having the proper protective equipment (OR=1.71 for symptoms of depression and
      OR=1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (OR=1.39 for anxiety).
      CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition
      that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated 
      factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher
      number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate 
      doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are
      primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as
      being a resident physician and self-perception of safety. Further studies are
      required as the pandemic evolves.

      Workers of a Tertiary Hospital in Ecuador and Associated Risk Factors.
PG  - 3433-3440
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S326148 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is resistant to
      most of the commonly used antibiotics and is therefore a public health issue.
      Colonization with MRSA is a risk factor for infection or transmission. PURPOSE:
      To determine the prevalence of colonization with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and
      MRSA strains in health care workers (HCWs) at a tertiary hospital in Ecuador and 
      to determine the risk factors associated with carriage. METHODS: Out of a cohort 
      of 3800 HCWs, 481 individuals from different hospital departments were randomly
      selected, and a single nasal swab was collected. Detection of SA and MRSA was
      carried out with the LightCycler((R)) MRSA Advanced Test. A questionnaire was
      performed that gathered demographic and occupational information of the
      participants to determine risk factors for MRSA colonization. Statistical
      analysis was performed with univariate and multivariate analysis and the
      R-software version 4.0.2. RESULTS: Colonization with SA and MRSA occurred in
      respectively 23.7% (95% CI, 22.7-24.6) and 5% (95% CI, 3.39-7.58) of the
      individuals. The multivariate analysis showed that being older in age (OD 1.09)
      and being male (OD 2.78) were risk factors for SA and MRSA colonization (p-value 
      < 0.001). Previous use of antibiotics or the use of nasal ointments diminished
      the colonization rates of SA (24% versus 3.7% and 10.1% respectively).
      CONCLUSION: About 20% of the HCWs who were colonized with SA were colonized with 
      MRSA, representing a risk for nosocomial infections and hospital outbreaks.
      Active monitoring and a decolonization treatment of the HCWs can reduce these
      risks.

AB  - Amblyomma mixtum is a Neotropical generalist tick of medical and veterinary
      importance which is widely distributed from United States of America to Ecuador. 
      The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the geographic projections of
      the ecological niche models of A. mixtum in climate change scenarios in America. 
      We constructed a database of published scientific publications, personal
      collections, personal communications, and online databases. Ecological niche
      modelling was performed with 15 Bioclimatic variables using kuenm in R and was
      projected to three time periods (Last Glacial Maximum, Current and 2050) for
      America. Our model indicated a wide distribution for A. mixtum, with higher
      probability of occurrence along the Gulf of Mexico and occurring in a lesser
      proportion in the Pacific states, Central America, and the northern part of South
      America. The areas of new invasion are located mainly on the border of Mexico
      with Guatemala and Belize, some regions of Central America and Colombia. We
      conclude that the ecological niche modelling are effective tools to infer the
      potential distribution of A. mixtum in America, in addition to helping to propose
      future measures of epidemiological control and surveillance in the new potential 
      areas of invasion.

AB  - The first phylogenetic hypotheses for the high Andean satyrine butterfly genus
      Altopedaliodes is proposed based on sequence data from mitochondrial (COI and
      COII) and nuclear (EF-1alpha) genes. Four species previously included in the
      genus were found not to be closely related to the clade containing the type
      species for Altopedaliodes, and these species are therefore removed and placed in
      the appropriate genus: Pedaliodes cocytia (C. Felder and R. Felder, 1867) n.
      comb., Pedaliodes nebris Thieme 1905rev. comb., Neopedaliodes tamaensis (Pyrcz
      and Viloria 2007) n. comb., and Altopedaliodes similis Henao, Paez and
      Rodriguez-M., 2017; the last name is here synonymized with Pedaliodes nebris
      (Thieme 1905) n. syn. A taxonomic revision of the twelve species in
      Altopedaliodes as newly circumscribed is presented and all the currently
      recognized taxa are revised. We describe two new species, A. llanganati Padron,
      Pyrcz and Willmott n. sp. (Ecuador, Napo) and A. pilimbala Pyrcz and Boyer n. sp.
      (Colombia, Cauca), and three new subspecies, A. reissi papallacta Padron, Pyrcz
      and Willmott n. ssp. (Ecuador, Napo), A. reissi dominica Pyrcz and Padron n. ssp.
      (Colombia, Valle del Cauca) and A. halli cagnoni Boyer, Pyrcz and Padron n. ssp. 
      (Ecuador, Morona-Santiago). A new status is proposed for A. nucea Pyrcz and
      Viloria 1999, n. stat., we combine Altopedaliodes scydmaena (Hayward, 1968) n.
      comb. and Altopedaliodes belmira (Pyrcz and Rodriguez, 2004), n. comb., n. stat. 
      into the genus and treat the latter taxon as a species, and we newly treat
      Altopedaliodes scydmaena kruegeri Pyrcz 1999n. stat. as a subspecies.

TI  - Adaptation and psychometric validation of Diabetes Health Profile (DHP-18) in
      patients with type 2 diabetes in Quito, Ecuador: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 189
LID - 10.1186/s12955-021-01818-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Diabetes Health Profile (DHP-18), structured in three
      dimensions (psychological distress (PD), barriers to activity (BA) and
      disinhibited eating (DE)), assesses the psychological and behavioural burden of
      living with type 2 diabetes. The objectives were to adapt the DHP-18
      linguistically and culturally for use with patients with type 2 DM in Ecuador,
      and to evaluate its psychometric properties. METHODS: Participants were recruited
      using purposive sampling through patient clubs at primary health centres in
      Quito, Ecuador. The DHP-18 validation consisted in the linguistic validation made
      by two Ecuadorian doctors and eight patient interviews. And in the psychometric
      validation, where participants provided clinical and sociodemographic data and
      responded to the SF-12v2 health survey and the linguistically and culturally
      adapted version of the DHP-18. The original measurement model was evaluated with 
      confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Reliability was assessed through internal
      consistency using Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reproducibility by
      administering DHP-18 in a random subgroup of the participants two weeks after (n 
      = 75) using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Convergent validity was
      assessed by establishing previous hypotheses of the expected correlations with
      the SF12v2 using Spearman's coefficient. RESULTS: Firstly, the DHP-18 was
      linguistically and culturally adapted. Secondly, in the psychometric validation, 
      we included 146 participants, 58.2% female, the mean age was 56.8 and 31% had
      diabetes complications. The CFA indicated a good fit to the original three factor
      model (chi2 (132) = 162.738, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.990; TLI = 0.989; SRMR = 0.086
      and RMSEA = 0.040. The BA dimension showed the lowest standardized factorial
      loads (lambda) (ranging from 0.21 to 0.77), while lambda ranged from 0.57 to 0.89
      and from 0.46 to 0.73, for the PD and DE dimensions respectively. Cronbach's
      alphas were 0.81, 0.63 and 0.74 and ICCs 0.70, 0.57 and 0.62 for PD, BA and DE,
      respectively. Regarding convergent validity, we observed weaker correlations than
      expected between DHP-18 dimensions and SF-12v2 dimensions (r > -0.40 in two of
      three hypotheses). CONCLUSIONS: The original three factor model showed good fit
      to the data. Although reliability parameters were adequate for PD and DE
      dimensions, the BA presented lower internal consistency and future analysis
      should verify the applicability and cultural equivalence of some of the items of 
      this dimension to Ecuador.

      Antimicrobial-Resistant Escherichia coli in Children Living in Semirural

AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL), a family of
      bacteria that includes Escherichia coli, have emerged as a global health threat. 
      This study examined risks associated with carriage of third-generation
      cephalosporin-resistant (3GC-R) E. coli, including ESBL-producing,
      multidrug-resistant, and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains in children
      living in semirural parishes of Quito, Ecuador. We conducted a longitudinal study
      with two cycles of sampling (N = 374, N = 366) that included an analysis of child
      fecal samples and survey questions relating to water, sanitation, and hygiene,
      socioeconomic status, household crowding, and animal ownership. We used
      multivariate regression models to assess risk factors associated with a child
      being colonized. Across the two cycles, 18.4% (n = 516) of the 3GC-R isolates
      were ESBL-producing E. coli, and 40.3% (n = 516) were XDR E. coli. Children
      living in households that owned between 11 and 20 backyard animals had an
      increased odds of being colonized with XDR E. coli (odds ratio [OR] = 1.94, 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-3.60) compared with those with no animals.
      Households that reported smelling odors from commercial poultry had increased
      odds of having a child positive for XDR E. coli (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.11-2.66).
      Our results suggest that colonization of children with antimicrobial-resistant E.
      coli is influenced by exposure to backyard and commercial livestock and poultry. 
      Future studies should consider community-level risk factors because child
      exposures to drug-resistant bacteria are likely influenced by neighborhood and
      regional risk factors.

TI  - Awake prone positioning and oxygen therapy in patients with COVID-19: the APRONOX
      study.
LID - 2100265 [pii]
LID - 10.1183/13993003.00265-2021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The awake prone positioning strategy for patients with acute
      respiratory distress syndrome is a safe, simple and cost-effective technique used
      to improve hypoxaemia. We aimed to evaluate intubation and mortality risk in
      patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who underwent awake prone
      positioning during hospitalisation. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre
      observational study conducted between 1 May 2020 and 12 June 2020 in 27 hospitals
      in Mexico and Ecuador, nonintubated patients with COVID-19 managed with awake
      prone or awake supine positioning were included to evaluate intubation and
      mortality risk through logistic regression models; multivariable and centre
      adjustment, propensity score analyses, and E-values were calculated to limit
      confounding. RESULTS: 827 nonintubated patients with COVID-19 in the awake prone 
      (n=505) and awake supine (n=322) groups were included for analysis. Fewer
      patients in the awake prone group required endotracheal intubation (23.6% versus 
      40.4%) or died (19.8% versus 37.3%). Awake prone positioning was a protective
      factor for intubation even after multivariable adjustment (OR 0.35, 95% CI
      0.24-0.52; p<0.0001, E=2.12), which prevailed after propensity score analysis (OR
      0.41, 95% CI 0.27-0.62; p<0.0001, E=1.86) and mortality (adjusted OR 0.38, 95% CI
      0.26-0.55; p<0.0001, E=2.03). The main variables associated with intubation among
      awake prone patients were increasing age, lower baseline peripheral arterial
      oxygen saturation/inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio (P aO2 /F IO2 ) and
      management with a nonrebreather mask. CONCLUSIONS: Awake prone positioning in
      hospitalised nonintubated patients with COVID-19 is associated with a lower risk 
      of intubation and mortality.

TI  - GNSS Constraints to Active Tectonic Deformations of the South American
      Continental Margin in Ecuador.
LID - 4003 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s21124003 [doi]
AB  - GNSS observations constitute the main tool to reveal Earth's crustal deformations
      in order to improve the identification of geological hazards. The Ecuadorian
      Andes were formed by Nazca Plate subduction below the Pacific margin of the South
      American Plate. Active tectonic-related deformation continues to present, and it 
      is constrained by 135 GPS stations of the RENAGE and REGME deployed by the IGM in
      Ecuador (1995.4-2011.0). They show a regional ENE displacement, increasing
      towards the N, of the deformed North Andean Sliver in respect to the South
      American Plate and Inca Sliver relatively stable areas. The heterogeneous
      displacements towards the NNE of the North Andean Sliver are interpreted as
      consequences of the coupling of the Carnegie Ridge in the subduction zone. The
      Dolores-Guayaquil megashear constitutes its southeastern boundary and includes
      the dextral to normal transfer Pallatanga fault, that develops the Guayaquil
      Gulf. This fault extends northeastward along the central part of the Cordillera
      Real, in relay with the reverse dextral Cosanga-Chingual fault and finally
      followed by the reverse dextral Sub-Andean fault zone. While the Ecuadorian
      margin and Andes is affected by ENE-WSW shortening, the easternmost Manabi Basin 
      located in between the Cordillera Costanera and the Cordillera Occidental of the 
      Andes, underwent moderate ENE-WSW extension and constitutes an active fore-arc
      basin of the Nazca plate subduction. The integration of the GPS and seismic data 
      evidences that highest rates of deformation and the highest tectonic hazards in
      Ecuador are linked: to the subduction zone located in the coastal area; to the
      Pallatanga transfer fault; and to the Eastern Andes Sub-Andean faults.

TI  - Disjoint and Functional Principal Component Analysis for Infected Cases and
      Deaths Due to COVID-19 in South American Countries with Sensor-Related Data.
LID - 4094 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s21124094 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we group South American countries based on the number of infected 
      cases and deaths due to COVID-19. The countries considered are: Argentina,
      Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay, and
      Venezuela. The data used are collected from a database of Johns Hopkins
      University, an institution that is dedicated to sensing and monitoring the
      evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. A statistical analysis, based on principal
      components with modern and recent techniques, is conducted. Initially, utilizing 
      the correlation matrix, standard components and varimax rotations are calculated.
      Then, by using disjoint components and functional components, the countries are
      grouped. An algorithm that allows us to keep the principal component analysis
      updated with a sensor in the data warehouse is designed. As reported in the
      conclusions, this grouping changes depending on the number of components
      considered, the type of principal component (standard, disjoint or functional)
      and the variable to be considered (infected cases or deaths). The results
      obtained are compared to the k-means technique. The COVID-19 cases and their
      deaths vary in the different countries due to diverse reasons, as reported in the
      conclusions.

TI  - Investigating genetic diversity in admixed populations from Ecuador.
PG  - 109-119
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.24341 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: According to demographic history, Ecuador has experienced shifts in
      its Native American populations caused by European colonization and the African
      slave trade. The continuous admixture events among Europeans, Native Americans,
      and Africans occurred differently in each region of the country, producing a
      stratified population. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the level
      of genetic substructure in the Ecuadorian Mestizo population. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 377 male and 209 female samples were genotyped for two sets
      of X-chromosomal markers (32 X-Indels and 12 X-STRs). Population analyses
      performed included Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests, LD analysis, PCA, pairwise
      FST s, and AMOVA. RESULTS: Significant levels of LD were observed between markers
      separated by distances of less than 1 cM, as well as between markers separated by
      distances varying from 10.891 to 163.53 cM. Among Ecuadorian regions, Amazonia
      showed the highest average R(2) value. DISCUSSION: When X-chromosomal and
      autosomal differentiation values were compared, a sex-biased admixture between
      European men and Native American and African women was revealed, as well as
      between African men and Native American women. Moreover, a distinct Native
      American ancestry was discernible in the Amazonian population, in addition to
      sex-biased gene flow between Amazonia and the Andes and Pacific coast regions.
      Overall, these results underline the importance of integrating X chromosome
      information to achieve a more comprehensive view of the genetic and demographic
      histories of South American admixed populations.

TI  - Preliminary Study on Tracing the Origin and Exploring the Relations between
      Growing Conditions and Isotopic and Elemental Fingerprints of Organic and
      Conventional Cavendish Bananas (Musa spp.).
LID - 1021 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods10051021 [doi]
AB  - The stable isotopic ratios and elemental compositions of 120 banana samples, Musa
      spp. (AAA Group, Cavendish Subgroup) cultivar Williams, collected from six
      countries (Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica Republic, Ecuador, Panama, Peru), were 
      determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass
      spectrometry. Growing conditions like altitude, temperature, rainfall and
      production system (organic or conventional cultivation) were obtained from the
      sampling farms. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed separation of the
      farms based on geographical origin and production system. The results showed a
      significant difference in the stable isotopic ratios (delta(13)C, delta(15)N,
      delta(18)O) and elemental compositions (Al, Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Rb) of the
      pulp and peel samples. Furthermore, delta(15)N was found to be a good marker for 
      organically produced bananas. A correlation analysis was conducted to show the
      linkage of growing conditions and compositional attributes. The delta(13)C of
      pulp and peel were mainly negatively correlated with the rainfall, while
      delta(18)O was moderately positively (R values ~0.5) correlated with altitude and
      temperature. A moderate correlation was also found between temperature and
      elements such as Ba, Fe, Mn, Ni and Sr in the pulp and peel samples. The PCA
      results and correlation analysis suggested that the differences of banana
      compositions were combined effects of geographical factors and production
      systems. Ultimately, the findings contribute towards understanding the
      compositional differences of bananas due to different growing conditions and
      production systems linked to a defined origin; thereby offering a tool to support
      the traceability of commercial fruits.

TI  - Design of Nature Tourism Route in Chimborazo Wildlife Reserve, Ecuador.
LID - 5293 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18105293 [doi]
AB  - The design of new routes is a specific strategy to improve tourism management and
      to increase the attractiveness of landscape features, promoting activities as a
      part of sustainable development. This study proposes the design of alternative
      multi-parameter tourist routes in the Chimborazo Wildlife Reserve based on
      spatial network analysis implemented in ArcGIS 10.5((R)) software. Tourist
      interest points were identified and mapped using spatial analysis software, then 
      two routes for bicycles and hiking were defined as being the most efficient,
      based on the most frequented tourist attractions. The main contribution of this
      study is the identification of optimal routes for vehicular, bicycling, and
      hiking traffic through tourist attractions, considering variables such as the
      time, distance, average circulation speed, road state, and tourist facilities. As
      a result, two routes were identified. Route one includes 17 tourist attractions, 
      five lodging establishments, four food centers, and one health center. On the
      other hand, route two includes 11 tourist attractions, two lodging and food
      establishments, and one health center. The final contribution of this research is
      to maximize tour satisfaction by presenting new routes of visiting tourist
      attractions due to the growing demand in the Chimborazo Reserve.

TI  - The Suffering of Advanced Chronic Renal Patients and Their Relationship with
      Symptoms in Loja, Ecuador.
LID - 5284 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18105284 [doi]
AB  - Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease (ACKD) supposes a public health problem in
      Ecuador that requires a comprehensive approach. In view of the scarcity of
      studies on the subject in this country, the objective of this research was to
      determine the signs and symptoms associated with the patients' physical, social
      and psychological spheres that allow properly developing palliative care. A
      longitudinal, prospective and observational study was conducted with ACKD
      patients. In order to assess the symptomatic burden and suffering of these
      patients, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System Revised: renal (ESAS-r) for
      renal patients and the Distress Thermometer (DT) were used. The sample consisted 
      of a total of 246 patients. The most common symptoms that affect them, causing
      them suffering in their daily lives, are those related to well-being, difficulty 
      falling asleep and itching. It is necessary that health professionals adapt care 
      measures and help patients undergoing renal treatment, especially those who have 
      suffered the disease for a longer period of time, in order to alleviate the
      patients' suffering and therefore improve their daily lives. To such an end, a
      care plan could be designed that includes early palliative care.

TI  - Tool to monitor tobacco control policy implementation: the Tobacco Control Scale 
      in Latin America. Adaptation process and pilot study.
LID - tobaccocontrol-2020-056395 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-056395 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring tobacco control policy implementation is one of the keys
      for tobacco consumption reduction in Latin America (LA). This study reports on
      the adaptation of the Tobacco Control Scale (TCS) for use in LA countries and the
      level of tobacco control policy implementation in this region according to the
      scale. METHODS: Ecological cross-sectional survey. The questionnaire to measure
      tobacco control policies was a translated (into Spanish and Portuguese) and
      adapted version of the last TCS as used in Europe. The resulting TCS-LA maintains
      the same structure as the original TCS, with eight policy domains and 100 points 
      (pts) as maximum score; however, four policy domains were adapted because the
      exact same rationale could not be applied. At least two non-governmental tobacco 
      control experts were contacted per country to answer the TCS-LA. RESULTS:
      Informants from 17 out of 18 countries completed the questionnaire. Using the
      TCS-LA, Panama (70 pts), Uruguay (68 pts) and Ecuador (61 pts) exhibited the
      strongest tobacco control policies, while Guatemala (32 pts), Bolivia (30 pts)
      and Dominican Republic (29 pts) have implemented a lower number of tobacco
      control policies. Eight countries reached 50% of the TCS-LA total possible score,
      indicating a relatively good implementation level of tobacco control policies.
      CONCLUSIONS: Panama, Uruguay and Ecuador are the tobacco control policy leaders
      in LA; however, tobacco control in the region has room for improvement since nine
      countries have a total score under 50 pts. The TCS is a feasible and adaptable
      tool to monitor tobacco control in other WHO regions beyond Europe.

TI  - First Report of Pantoea ananatis causing leaf spot disease of maize in Ecuador.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-02-21-0298-PDN [doi]
AB  - Maize (Zea mays) is the second most cultivated grain crop in Ecuador, with
      growing significance as a source of fodder and food. During the rainy season
      (November and December) of 2018 and 2019, a disease of maize that was not
      previously observed in Ecuador was found at commercial fields of Misqui Sara
      variety, at four parishes of canton Quito (Tumbaco, Pifo, Puembo, and Checa),
      province of Pichincha. Infected plants, at tassel initiation, displayed symptoms 
      of localized chlorotic streaks on leaves that expanded with time, and around a
      month later turned necrotic. Severely affected plants wilted and died. Symptoms
      appeared in lower leaves first and were later observed in upper leaves as the
      disease progressed. Disease incidence was between 20 and 30% in the affected
      plantations, with around 30% of infected plants wilting and dying, resulting in
      20-25% of yield losses. Upper leaves from ten symptomatic plants, five from
      Puembo and five from Checa, were collected randomly. Two 0.5 cm2 pieces of leaf
      from each plant were excised from the margins of the necrotic lesions, surface
      sterilized and macerated in 9 mL of sterile peptone water. The 10-3 dilutions
      were plated onto nutrient agar and incubated at 28 degrees C for 24 hours.
      Yellow, mucoid colonies were isolated on nutrient agar. Three isolates from
      Puembo and two from Checa were selected for testing Koch s postulates and further
      biochemical and molecular characterization. Isolates were Gram-negative rods,
      oxidase negative, catalase, indol and citrate positive. Fragments of the 16S,
      gyrB, and rpoB loci were amplified and sequenced using the 27F/1492R (Lane, D.
      J., 1991), UP-1/UP-2r (Yamamoto & Harayama, 1995), and rpoBCM81-F/rpoBCM32b-R
      (Brady, C., et al., 2008) primer pairs, respectively. All isolates presented
      identical sequences for the different loci, therefore only sequences from isolate
      FP191505 were deposited in GenBank (GenBank accession no. MW528428-MW528430). A
      search of homologous sequences using BLAST resulted in identities of 99.3, 99.7, 
      and 100 % for 16S, gyrB, and rpoB, respectively, with sequences from Pantoea
      ananatis type specimen LGM 2665 (Brady, C., et al., 2008; Hauben, L., et al.,
      1998; GenBank accession nos NR_119362.1, EF988824.1 EF988996.1), indicating that 
      our isolates belong to this species. Pathogenicity tests were performed by
      syringe infiltration of bacterial suspensions. Each one of the five characterized
      P. ananatis isolates was inoculated in four leaves (500 ul of 1 x 108 CFU mL-1
      per leave) of three healthy maize plants. Negative control plants were
      infiltrated with sterile distilled water. Plants were incubated at 28-30 degrees 
      C and 60% relative humidity for 24 hours. Later, plants were maintained in a
      greenhouse with 27 degrees C/21 degrees C day/night temperatures and observed
      daily. After six weeks all bacteria-inoculated plants developed symptoms of
      chlorosis and necrosis while the control was symptomless. Bacteria were
      re-isolated from symptomatic leaves and identified as P. ananatis following the
      same methodologies used for the initial identification. To our knowledge, this is
      the first report of P. ananatis causing leaf spot of maize in Ecuador.

AB  - Dogs are a reservoir for Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), 
      and other companion vector-borne diseases, including ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia
      canis and Ehrlichia ewingii), anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum and
      Anaplasma platys), dirofilariasis (Dirofilaria immitis) and Lyme disease
      (Borrelia burgdorferi). This study has two key objectives: 1) to determine
      seroreactivity against T. cruzi in dogs from the town of Colon, in Portoviejo
      city, in the central coast of Ecuador; and 2) to establish the coinfection
      frequency of other companion vector-borne diseases in dogs positive for T. cruzi.
      Antibodies against T. cruzi were detected using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assays. Diagnostic consensus between ELISA tests was established using the
      Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Other haemoparasitic diseases were detected using the 
      IDEXX SNAP(R) 4Dx(R) kit in dogs previously diagnosed as T. cruzi-seropositive.
      From 84 dogs sampled, 57.14% (48/84) tested positive for T. cruzi. Co-infection
      analysis of 25 dogs positive for T. cruzi revealed antibodies also against
      Ehrlichia spp. (48%), Anaplasma spp. (28%), and Dirofilaria immitis (12%). These 
      results provide a novel perspective regarding the status of these pathogens which
      co-infect dogs in Colon. Since all these pathogens are zoonotic, our findings
      should warn regional health authorities to implement sanitary programs, to better
      prevent and control vectors associated to these pathogens. On the other hand,
      human and veterinarian doctors, should consider that patients with a cardiac
      infection condition could be suffering co-infections with two or more vector
      transmitted pathogens.

TI  - Under pressure: phenotypic divergence and convergence associated with
      microhabitat adaptations in Triatominae.
PG  - 195
LID - 10.1186/s13071-021-04647-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triatomine bugs, the vectors of Chagas disease, associate with
      vertebrate hosts in highly diverse ecotopes. It has been proposed that occupation
      of new microhabitats may trigger selection for distinct phenotypic variants in
      these blood-sucking bugs. Although understanding phenotypic variation is key to
      the study of adaptive evolution and central to phenotype-based taxonomy, the
      drivers of phenotypic change and diversity in triatomines remain poorly
      understood. METHODS/RESULTS: We combined a detailed phenotypic appraisal
      (including morphology and morphometrics) with mitochondrial cytb and nuclear ITS2
      DNA sequence analyses to study Rhodnius ecuadoriensis populations from across the
      species' range. We found three major, naked-eye phenotypic variants.
      Southern-Andean bugs primarily from vertebrate-nest microhabitats (Ecuador/Peru) 
      are typical, light-colored, small bugs with short heads/wings. Northern-Andean
      bugs from wet-forest palms (Ecuador) are dark, large bugs with long heads/wings. 
      Finally, northern-lowland bugs primarily from dry-forest palms (Ecuador) are
      light-colored and medium-sized. Wing and (size-free) head shapes are similar
      across Ecuadorian populations, regardless of habitat or phenotype, but distinct
      in Peruvian bugs. Bayesian phylogenetic and multispecies-coalescent DNA sequence 
      analyses strongly suggest that Ecuadorian and Peruvian populations are two
      independently evolving lineages, with little within-lineage phylogeographic
      structuring or differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: We report sharp naked-eye phenotypic
      divergence of genetically similar Ecuadorian R. ecuadoriensis (nest-dwelling
      southern-Andean vs palm-dwelling northern bugs; and palm-dwelling Andean vs
      lowland), and sharp naked-eye phenotypic similarity of typical, yet genetically
      distinct, southern-Andean bugs primarily from vertebrate-nest (but not palm)
      microhabitats. This remarkable phenotypic diversity within a single nominal
      species likely stems from microhabitat adaptations possibly involving
      predator-driven selection (yielding substrate-matching camouflage coloration) and
      a shift from palm-crown to vertebrate-nest microhabitats (yielding smaller bodies
      and shorter and stouter heads). These findings shed new light on the origins of
      phenotypic diversity in triatomines, warn against excess reliance on
      phenotype-based triatomine-bug taxonomy, and confirm the Triatominae as an
      informative model system for the study of phenotypic change under ecological
      pressure .

TI  - A world-wide analysis of reduced sensitivity to DMI fungicides in the banana
      pathogen Pseudocercospora fijiensis.
PG  - 3273-3288
LID - 10.1002/ps.6372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudocercospora fijiensis is the causal agent of the black leaf
      streak disease (BLSD) of banana. Bananas are important global export commodities 
      and a major staple food. Their susceptibility to BLSD pushes disease management
      towards excessive fungicide use, largely relying on multisite inhibitors and
      sterol demethylation inhibitors (DMIs). These fungicides are ubiquitous in plant 
      disease control, targeting the CYP51 enzyme. We examined sensitivity to DMIs in
      P. fijiensis field isolates collected from various major banana production zones 
      in Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, the Philippines, Guadalupe,
      Martinique and Cameroon and determined the underlying genetic reasons for the
      observed phenotypes. RESULTS: We observed a continuous range of sensitivity
      towards the DMI fungicides difenoconazole, epoxiconazole and propiconazole with
      clear cross-sensitivity. Sequence analyses of PfCYP51 in 266 isolates showed 28
      independent amino acid substitutions, nine of which correlated with reduced
      sensitivity to DMIs. In addition to the mutations, we observed up to six
      insertions in the Pfcyp51 promoter. Such promoter insertions contain repeated
      elements with a palindromic core and correlate with the enhanced expression of
      Pfcyp51 and hence with reduced DMI sensitivity. Wild-type isolates from unsprayed
      bananas fields did not contain any promoter insertions. CONCLUSION: The presented
      data significantly contribute to understanding of the evolution and global
      distribution of DMI resistance mechanisms in P. fijiensis field populations and
      facilitate the prediction of different DMI efficacy. The overall reduced DMI
      sensitivity calls for the deployment of a wider range of solutions for
      sustainable control of this major banana disease. (c) 2021 The Authors. Pest

TI  - An Abnormally High Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Is Not an Independent Outcome
      Predictor in AQP4-IgG-Positive NMOSD.
PG  - 628024
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2021.628024 [doi]
AB  - Background: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been investigated in
      many autoimmune conditions as a biomarker of inflammation and/or disease
      activity. The role of NLR in AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum
      disorders (NMOSD) is far from clear. In this study, NLR was evaluated in patients
      with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD at disease onset and its prognostic impact was
      subsequently assessed. Methods: In this multicenter study, we retrospectively
      included all recent/newly diagnosed treatment-naive patients with
      AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD (n=90) from three different countries in Latin America
      (LATAM): Argentina, Ecuador, and Mexico. NLR was compared between
      AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD and healthy controls (HC, n = 365). Demographic,
      clinical, paraclinical (including imaging), and prognostic data at 12 and 24
      months were also evaluated. Multivariate regression analysis was used to describe
      and identify independent associations between the log-transformed NLR and
      clinical (relapses and EDSS) and imaging (new/enlarging and/or contrast-enhancing
      MRI lesions) outcomes. Results: NLR was higher in NMOSD patients during the first
      attack compared with HC (2.9 +/- 1.6 vs 1.8 +/- 0.6; p<0.0001). Regardless of
      immunosuppressant's initiation at disease onset, NLR remained higher in NMOSD
      patients at 12 (2.8 +/- 1.3; p<0.0001) and 24 (3.1 +/- 1.6; p<0.0001) months. No 
      association was found at 12 and 24 months between the log-transformed NLR and the
      presence of relapses, new/enlarging and/or contrast-enhancing MRI lesions, and/or
      physical disability. Conclusions: In this cohort of LATAM patients with
      AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, NLR was abnormally high in attacks but also during
      follow-up. However, a high NLR was not an independent predictor of clinical or
      imaging outcomes in our models.

TI  - Quinoa in Ecuador: Recent Advances under Global Expansion.
LID - 298 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants10020298 [doi]
AB  - Quinoa is a highly diverse crop domesticated in the Andean region of South
      America with broad adaptation to a wide range of marginal environments. Quinoa
      has garnered interest worldwide due to its nutritional and health benefits. Over 
      the last decade, quinoa production has expanded outside of the Andean region,
      prompting multiple studies investigating the potential for quinoa cultivation in 
      novel environments. Currently, quinoa is grown in countries spanning five
      continents, including North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Here, we 
      update the advances of quinoa research in Ecuador across different topics,
      including (a) current quinoa production situation with a focus on breeding
      progress, (b) traditional seed production, and (c) the impact of the work of the 
      nongovernment organization "European Committee for Training and Agriculture" with
      quinoa farmers in Chimborazo province. Additionally, we discuss genetic
      diversity, primary pests and diseases, actions for adapting quinoa to tropical
      areas, and recent innovations in quinoa processing in Ecuador. Finally, we report
      a case study describing a participatory breeding project between Washington State
      University and the Association of Andean Seed and Nutritional Food Producers
      Mushuk Yuyay in the province of Canar.

TI  - Statistical data driven approach of COVID-19 in Ecuador: R 0 and R t estimation
      via new method.
PG  - 232-243
LID - 10.1016/j.idm.2020.12.012 [doi]
AB  - The growth of COVID-19 pandemic throughout more than 213 countries around the
      world have put a lot of pressures on governments and health services to try to
      stop the rapid expansion of the pandemic. During 2009, H1N1 Influenza pandemic,
      statistical and mathematical methods were used to track how the virus spreads
      around countries. Most of these models that were developed at the beginning of
      the XXI century are based on the classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
      model developed almost a hundred years ago. The evolution of this model allows us
      to forecast and compute basic and effective reproduction numbers (R t and R 0 ), 
      measures that quantify the epidemic potential of a pathogen and estimates
      different scenarios. In this study, we present a traditional estimation technique
      for R 0 with statistical distributions by best fitting and a Bayesian approach
      based on continuous feed of prior distributions to obtain posterior distributions
      and computing real time R t . We use data from COVID-19 officially reported cases
      in Ecuador since the first confirmed case on February 29th. Because of the lack
      of data, in the case of R 0 we compare two methods for the estimation of these
      parameters below exponential growth and maximum likelihood estimation. We do not 
      make any assumption about the evolution of cases due to limited information and
      we use previous methods to compare scenarios about R 0 and in the case of R t we 
      used Bayesian inference to model uncertainty in contagious proposing a new
      modification to the well-known model of Bettencourt and Ribeiro based on a time
      window of m days to improve estimations. Ecuadorian R 0 with exponential growth
      criteria was 3.45 and with the maximum likelihood estimation method was 2.93. The
      results show that Guayas, Pichincha and Manabi were the provinces with the
      highest number of cases due to COVID-19. Some reasons explain the increased
      transmissibility in these localities: massive events, population density, cities 
      dispersion patterns, and the delayed time of public health actions to contain
      pandemic. In conclusion, this is a novel approach that allow us to measure
      infection dynamics and outbreak distribution when not enough detailed data is
      available. The use of this model can be used to predict pandemic distribution and
      to implement data-based effective measures.

LID - rs.3.rs-141245 [pii]
LID - 10.21203/rs.3.rs-141245/v1 [doi]
AB  - Background : Latin America has now become the epicenter of the global coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, a profound
      burden of SARS-COV-2 infection has been reported in Latin America. In the present
      study, we aim to determine the profiles that are associated with this disease in 
      Latin America. We analyzed symptoms, morbidities and gastrointestinal (GI)
      manifestations by country. Methods: We analyzed data from SARS-CoV-2 positive
      patients evaluated at healthcare centers and hospitals of 8 Latin American
      countries including Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela,
      Ecuador, and Bolivia between March 1 and July 30, 2020. These countries consist
      of a total population that exceeds 519 million. Demographics, comorbidities and
      clinical symptoms were collected. Statistical descriptive analysis and
      correlation analyses of symptoms, comorbidities and lethality were performed.
      Results: A total of 728,282 patients tested positive for COVID-19 across all the 
      8 Latin American countries. Of these, 52.6% were female. The average age was 48.4
      years. Peru had the oldest cohort with 56.8 years old and highest rate of females
      (56.8%) while Chile had the youngest cohort (39 years old). Venezuela had the
      highest male prevalence (56.7%). Most common symptoms were cough with 60.1%
      (Bolivia had the highest rate 78%), fatigue/tiredness with 52.0%, sore throat
      with 50.3%, and fever with 44.2%. Bolivia had fever as the top symptom (83.3%).
      GI symptoms including diarrhea (highest in Mexico with 22.9%), nausea, vomiting, 
      and abdominal pain were not associated with higher mortality. Hypertension was
      among the top (12.1%) comorbidities followed by diabetes with 8.3% and obesity
      4.5%. In multivariable analyses, the leading and significant comorbidities were
      hypertension (r=0.83, p=0.02), diabetes (r=0.91, p=0.01), and obesity (r=0.86,
      p=0.03). Asthma (r=0.37, p=0.54) and increasing age (0.13 p=0.81) were not
      independently associated with higher mortality. Lethality was highest in Mexico
      (16.6%) and lowest in Venezuela (0.9%) among the analyzed cohorts. Conclusion:
      Nearly, 10.5%-53% of patients with COVID-19 have GI manifestations. Differential 
      clinical symptoms were associated with COVID-19 in Latin America countries.
      Metabolic syndrome components were the main comorbidities associated with poor
      outcome. Country-specific management and prevention plans are needed.
      Country-specific management and prevention plans can be established from this
      meta-analysis.

      working conditions, productivity, distribution of time between work activities,
      and job satisfaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A digital survey was created using
      the Google Forms platform. It was distributed to all rheumatologist members of
      the Ecuadorian Society of Rheumatology. The data analysis was carried out using
      the statistical program SPSS v.23(R). RESULTS: A total of 64 surveys were
      received. The response rate was 86.48%. 62.5% were men and 37.5% women, with an
      average age of 40.76 +/- 9.18. The main workplace was state/public hospital
      (56.3%). The average working hours per week were 40.35 +/- 25.72. Most
      rheumatologists in Ecuador (62.5%) received their training abroad. 79.7% of
      rheumatologists earn less than $ 49,000 annually. The mean retirement age was
      66.51 +/- 6.7, and 54.7% have a retirement plan. The average satisfaction of
      Ecuadorian rheumatologists was 5.4 +/- 1.33 [0-7]; 17.2% are very dissatisfied
      with their annual income. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first recorded data on the
      characteristics of rheumatologists in Ecuador. Most rheumatologists obtained
      their specialist degree abroad. In general, rheumatologists in Ecuador are
      satisfied with their clinical practice and dissatisfied with their annual income 
      and job security.

TI  - A Novel Chemical Profile of a Selective In Vitro Cholinergic Essential Oil from
      Clinopodium taxifolium (Kunth) Govaerts (Lamiaceae), a Native Andean Species of
      Ecuador.

AB  - A novel chemical profile essential oil, distilled from the aerial parts of
      Clinopodium taxifolium (Kunth) Govaerts (Lamiaceae), was analysed by Gas
      Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS, qualitative analysis) and Gas
      Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID, quantitative analysis),
      with both polar and non-polar stationary phase columns. The chemical composition 
      mostly consisted of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids (>70%), the main ones
      being (E)-beta-caryophyllene (17.8%), alpha-copaene (10.5%), beta-bourbonene
      (9.9%), delta-cadinene (6.6%), cis-cadina-1(6),4-diene (6.4%) and germacrene D
      (4.9%), with the non-polar column. The essential oil was then submitted to
      enantioselective GC analysis, with a
      diethyl-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-beta-cyclodextrin diluted in PS-086 chiral
      selector, resulting in the following enantiomeric excesses for the chiral
      components: (1R,5S)-(-)-alpha-thujene (67.8%), (1R,5R)-(+)-alpha-pinene (85.5%), 
      (1S,5S)-(-)-beta-pinene (90.0%), (1S,5S)-(-)-sabinene (12.3%), (S)-(-)-limonene
      (88.1%), (S)-(+)-linalool (32.7%), (R)-(-)-terpinen-4-ol (9.3%),
      (S)-(-)-alpha-terpineol (71.2%) and (S)-(-)-germacrene D (89.0%). The inhibition 
      activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) of 
      C. taxifolium essential oil was then tested, resulting in selective activity
      against BChE with an IC50 value of 31.3 +/- 3.0 mug/mL (positive control:
      donepezil, IC50 = 3.6 mug/mL).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Introduction: in children the use of therapeutic interventions,
      which includes the administration of medications, is based on body weight.
      Objective: to validate the equations proposed by "Advanced Pediatric Life Support
      - APLS" in 2011 (APLS 1) and 2001 (APLS 2) to estimate weight in Ecuadorian girls
      and boys, considering their ethnic diversity and age groups. Methods: a
      cross-sectional study which included 21,735 girls and boys belonging to three
      ethnic groups: mestizo, indigenous, and other (white, black, and mulatto), with
      ages between 0 and 12 years, who participated in the ENSANUT-ECU study.
      Differences, Spearman's correlation, Bland-Altman graphs, and percentage error
      (PE) were calculated. Data were processed and analyzed using R. Results: APLS 1
      tends to overestimate weight whereas APLS 2 underestimates it. The estimated
      weight bias was greater for the classical equation. The indigenous and "other"
      ethnic groups presented the highest differences with respect to measured weight. 
      The differences between estimated weight and measured weight increased
      progressively with age. With APLS 1, the percentage of individuals with a PE > 10
      % was greater than with APLS 2. Conclusions: APLS does not accurately estimate
      weight in the Ecuadorian pediatric population. The difference between estimated
      weight and measured weight is sensitive to ethnic and age differences.

TI  - Broiler Farms and Carcasses Are an Important Reservoir of Multi-Drug Resistant
      Escherichia coli in Ecuador.
PG  - 547843
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2020.547843 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major health threat for public and animal
      health in the twenty-first century. In Ecuador, antibiotics have been used by the
      poultry industry for decades resulting in the presence of multi-drug resistant
      (MDR) bacteria in the poultry meat production chain, with the consequent risk for
      public health. This study evaluated the prevalence of ESBL/AmpC and mcr genes in 
      third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli (3GC-R E. coli)
      isolated from broiler farms (animal component), broiler carcasses (food
      component), and human enteritis (human component) in Quito-Ecuador. Samples were 
      collected weekly from November 2017 to November 2018. For the animal, food, and
      human components, 133, 335, and 302 samples were analyzed, respectively. Profiles
      of antimicrobial resistance were analyzed by an automated microdilution system.
      Resistance genes were studied by PCR and Sanger sequencing. From all samples, 122
      (91.7%), 258 (77%), and 146 (48.3%) samples were positive for 3GC-R E. coli in
      the animal, food, and human components, respectively. Most of the isolates
      (472/526, 89.7%) presented MDR phenotypes. The ESBL bla CTX-M-55, bla CTX-M-3,
      bla CTX-M-15, bla CTX-M-65, bla CTX-M-27, and bla CTX-M-14 were the most
      prevalent ESBL genes while bla CMY-2 was the only AmpC detected gene. The mcr-1
      gene was found in 20 (16.4%), 26 (10.1%), and 3 (2.1%) of isolates from animal,
      food, and human components, respectively. The implication of poultry products in 
      the prevalence of ESBL/AmpC and mcr genes in 3GC-R must be considered in the
      surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - Presence of the Reflective and Critical Thinking Capacity in Nursing Curricula in
      Iberian America.
LID - 10.17533/udea.iee.v38n3e14 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective was to identify the presence of the capacity for
      reflexive-critical thinking or similar, in Nursing Curricula in Iberian America. 
      METHODS: The article gathers the results of one of the objectives of the
      macro-project developed by the Iberian American Network on Nursing Education
      Research, titled Strategies to develop reflective and critical thinking in
      nursing students: Iberian America situation. To achieve this, a descriptive and
      exploratory research was conducted with qualitative approach. An instrument
      created for this project was used, along with some guiding questions to focus the
      information. RESULTS: Eight countries participated (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia,
      Ecuador, Spain, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela), which contributed information from 
      189 curricular plans. The R&CT was found in the majority of the curricula,
      although with diverse denominations. The principal learning strategies used were 
      problem-based learning, group dynamics, reflective reading, clinical practice,
      and simulation laboratories. The evaluation methods used are the knowledge test, 
      case analysis, and practical exam. CONCLUSIONS: Significant stress exists in the 
      discourse and curricular organization. Incongruences were found and a clear
      inclination toward the formation of professionals with broad technical skills
      under a traditional, memory, banking and knowledge accumulation education.

AB  - We describe a new Pristimantis species from the eastern Andes, Region Junin, Peru
      following an integrative taxonomic approach. The description is based on three
      adult males (snout-vent length 25.7-28.8 mm) collected in two montane forests
      between 1615 and 1800 m a.s.l. in the Pui Pui Protected Forest and its close
      surroundings. The new species is mainly characterised by absence of tympanum,
      presence of inner tarsal fold, broad horizontal red band across iris, ventre
      mottled black and cream and ventral surfaces of thighs salmon and grey mottled.
      Amongst the Amazonian and montane forest Pristimantis that have the ventre and
      groin contrastingly black and cream mottled, P. sinschi sp. nov. is
      morphologically most similar to P. lindae and P. ventrimarmoratus. However, DNA
      barcoding revealed a clear distinction between these three species and placed P. 
      sinschi sp. nov. as sister taxon of P. lindae. We designate a lectotype for P.
      ventrimarmoratus and restrict the type locality of this species to "El Topo, R.
      Pastaza, [Provincia Tungurahua,] E. Ecuador, 4200 feet". Pristimantis albertus
      and P. sagittulus are recorded for the first time in the Region Junin. Additional
      data on morphology and systematics are provided for P. albertus.

TI  - Validity of the Fitzpatrick Skin Phototype Classification in Ecuador.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1097/01.ASW.0000721168.40561.a3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Fitzpatrick Skin Phototype Classification (FSPC) is the most
      common tool used to assess skin phototype in White populations according to the
      amount of pigment the skin has and its reaction to sun exposure. Scientific
      evidence about the use of this scale for persons with darker skin is limited.
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the internal consistency, reliability, and construct
      validity of the FSPC for Ecuadorians. METHODS: This observational cross-sectional
      study recruited participants of both sexes between 40 and 90 years of age living 
      in a rural area of Quito, Ecuador. Cronbach alpha values were used to assess the 
      internal consistency of the scale. Construct validity was assessed with
      confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: The internal consistency coefficients
      indicated that the reliability of the responses to the scale was fair. Total
      alpha value was .515, whereas the alpha values of the two factors were .42 and
      .67. Most item-to-factor correlations had a low to moderate magnitude, ranging
      from r = 0.30 to 0.37. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor
      solution and achieved good overall fit as indicated by root mean square error of 
      approximation = 0.08, and nonnormed fit index = 0.88 was mediocre.
      Goodness-of-fit chi = 177.10, P < .001. The factor loads were greater than 0.30, 
      ranging from 0.30 to 0.99. CONCLUSIONS: The FSPC showed an acceptable construct
      validity and a fair internal consistency. The five-item scale could potentially
      be used as an effective instrument for assessing skin phototype in non-White
      people.

TI  - The Flower Essential Oil of Dalea mutisii Kunth (Fabaceae) from Ecuador:
      Chemical, Enantioselective, and Olfactometric Analyses.
LID - E1403 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants9101403 [doi]
AB  - An essential oil was distilled with 0.25% yield from fresh flowers of Dalea
      mutisii Kunth, a native species mainly growing in the Andean region of Ecuador. A
      total of 50 compounds were identified, and most of them were quantified. The
      chemical composition was characterized by the prevalence of monoterpene
      hydrocarbons (>90%). Major components were alpha-pinene (42.9%), beta-pinene
      (15.1%), beta-phellandrene (12.6%), myrcene (6.7%), and (Z)-beta-ocimene (5.4%). 
      The essential oil was then submitted to enantioselective analysis, with a
      2,3-diethyl-6-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-beta-cyclodextrin-based capillary column.
      An enantiomeric excess was measured for (1R,5R)-(+)-alpha-pinene (91.6%),
      (1R,5R)-(+)-beta-pinene (15.2%), (R)-(-)-alpha-phellandrene (4.8%), and
      (R)-(-)-beta-phellandrene (88.8%), whereas (R)-(+)-limonene was enantiomerically 
      pure. A gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) analysis was additionally carried 
      out on this pleasantly fragrant essential oil, following an aroma extract
      dilution analysis (AEDA) approach. Main odorants were alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, 
      alpha-phellandrene, and (Z)-beta-ocimene, with dilution factors (FD) of 8, 4, 2, 
      and 2, respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Older adults are at increased risk of violence. In
      order to prevent this, it is necessary to identify associated risk factors. The
      objective of the present study was to determine the association between violence 
      and various socio-demographic factors (age, gender, ethnic group, level of
      education, and place of residence) in older adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Cross-sectional study that included participants from the SABE-Ecuador study, who
      were selected through probabilistic sampling and came from all over the national 
      territory. Data were analysed with R using ordinal logistic regression models.
      RESULTS: Sample included 4321 older adults, women (52%) and men (48%), with a
      mean age of 72 years (SD 8). Having suffered violence was reported in 21.3% (n = 
      922) of older adults. It was observed that the odds of suffering violence was
      lower in men than in women (OR = 0.753, p< .001), decreased as age increased (OR 
      = 0.989, p = .012) and decreased as level of education increased (primary vs. no 
      education OR = 0.866, p = .001; secondary vs. no education OR = 0.622, p = .003; 
      higher vs. no education OR = 0.323, p< .001). CONCLUSIONS: Being a woman and
      having a low level of education is associated with an increased risk of violence 
      in older adults. Reducing gender gap and improving access to education for older 
      adults could reduce their risk of violence.

TI  - New finding of Rhadinoloricaria macromystax (Siluriformes: Loricariidae):
      redescription of the genus and description of a new species from Ecuador.
PG  - zootaxa.4779.4.2
LID - 10.11646/zootaxa.4779.4.2 [doi]
AB  - The fish collection from the Museum of Escuela Politecnica Nacional, Quito,
      Ecuador, has nine lots with 12 specimens assigned to genus Rhadinoloricaria.
      Specimens come from the Napo and Pastaza rivers, Amazon River basin, eastern
      Ecuador. One specimen matches accurately with figures and original description of
      Loricaria macromystax Gunther, 1869, type species of Rhadinoloricaria. After 150 
      years, this is the first secure identification of the species, which allowed an
      accurate description of the genus Rhadinoloricaria, and the discovery of a new
      species from Ecuador, described herein. In addition, using available specimens,
      figures and literature, a comparative analysis on external morphology was
      performed among the eight species included in Rhadinoloricaria. The analysis
      documented significant differences between them, in some morphological external
      characters and in buccal ornamentation. The results suggest that the eight
      species can be grouped into three or four genera. Rhadinoloricaria, in strict
      sense, has two species. Apistoloricaria is considered a valid genus, and include 
      the four species previously assigned to it. Rhadinoloricaria bahuaja and R. rhami
      do not belong to the known genera in the Pseudohemiodon group. At this time,
      available data suggests that both species could continue included in
      'Rhadinoloricaria', waiting further analyses to solve their generic status.
      Results support the use of buccal ornamentation patterns alone or combined with
      some morphological characters as valuable tool for generic identification within 
      Loricariini.

AB  - This work examined the adsorption capacity of sugarcane bagasse (SB) for the
      removal of ciprofloxacin (CPX) from water using batch experiments and a fixed bed
      column and compared its adsorption performance with a powdered activated
      commercial carbon (PAC). Both adsorbents achieved a similar percentage removal of
      about 78% with doses of 3gL(-1) of SB and 0.3gL(-1) of PAC (20mgL(-1) initial CPX
      concentration at 30 degrees C). The maximum removal was obtained at a pH between 
      6 and 8. SB adsorption isotherms were fitted to the Langmuir, BET and Freundlich 
      models showing a maximum adsorption capacity of 13.6mgg(-1). The kinetic data for
      both SB and PAC fitted the pseudo second-order model (R(2)=0.99). The adsorption 
      process was faster on the SB (65% of elimination in the first 5min) than on the
      PAC. The study of the adsorbent properties shows that SB is a macroporous solid
      with a specific surface area 250 times smaller than PAC. The thermodynamic
      results show that SB adsorption was physical and exothermic. The main suggested
      interactions between CPX and SB are electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding
      and dipole-dipole interactions. The experiments carried out in a fixed bed show
      that the adsorption capacity at breakthrough increases with the bed height. The
      adsorption capacity at saturation time was 9.47mgg(-1) at a flow rate of
      3mLmin(-1), a bed height of 14cm, and a diameter of 1.5cm. The experimental data 
      were fitted to the Bohart-Adams model (R(2)=0.98). These results highlight the
      capacity of sugarcane bagasse to adsorb ciprofloxacin from water, illustrating
      its potential as a low-cost adsorbent.

TI  - Exploration of the psychometric properties of the Clinical Outcomes in Routine
      Evaluation-Outcome Measure in Ecuador.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM)
      is a pan-theoretical and pan-diagnostic measure of mental health designed to
      cover issues that people wish to change in psychotherapy. The objective of this
      study was to explore the psychometric properties of the Spanish translation of
      the CORE-OM, in a country, Ecuador for which there is not a single measure
      suitable for this purpose with empirically demonstrated local acceptability and
      psychometric properties. METHODS: In total, 886 adults not currently receiving
      psychotherapy treatment or taking psychotropic medication were included in the
      analysis. The analyses broadly followed and compared with results from previous
      studies. These analyses consisted of assessment of acceptability, internal
      consistency, test-retest reliability, influences of demographic variables,
      correlations between domain scores, and convergent validity with Spanish versions
      of the Outcome Questionnaire 45.2 and Schwartz Outcome Scale-10. RESULTS: The
      questionnaire showed good acceptability (overall omission rate of 0.56%), good
      reliability (alpha = .93 [.92, .94], test-retest correlations ranged from .59 to 
      .85), and good convergent validity with the Outcome Questionnaire 45.2 (r = .84) 
      and the Schwartz Outcome Scale-10 (r = -.73). Statistically significant gender
      differences were found in two domains: females scored higher on Well-being (M =
      1.23) than males (M = 1.01), though effect size was small (g = 0.31); and males
      (M = 0.31) scored higher than females on Risk (M = 0.25), with even smaller
      effect size (g = 0.06). Age was negatively correlated with psychological distress
      in all domains and coefficients ranged from -.14 for Risk to -.29 for
      Functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of the CORE-OM as a valid
      and reliable instrument in a non-clinical Ecuadorean population. Exploration of
      the psychometric properties in a clinical population is recommended to assure its
      use in clinical settings.

TI  - Effect of childhood rotavirus vaccination on community rotavirus prevalence in
      rural Ecuador, 2008-13.
PG  - 1691-1701
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyaa124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although live attenuated monovalent human rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix)
      efficacy has been characterized through randomized studies, its effectiveness,
      especially in non-clinical settings, is less clear. In this study, we estimate
      the impact of childhood Rotarix(R) vaccination on community rotavirus prevalence.
      METHODS: We analyse 10 years of serial population-based diarrhoea case-control
      study, which also included testing for rotavirus infection (n = 3430), and 29
      months of all-cause diarrhoea active surveillance from a child cohort (n = 376)
      from rural Ecuador during a period in which Rotarix vaccination was introduced.
      We use weighted logistic regression from the case-control data to assess changes 
      in community rotavirus prevalence (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) and
      all-cause diarrhoea after the vaccine was introduced. We also assess changes in
      all-cause diarrhoea rates in the child cohort (born 2008-13) using Cox
      regression, comparing time to first all-cause diarrhoea case by vaccine status.
      RESULTS: Overall, vaccine introduction among age-eligible children was associated
      with a 82.9% reduction [95% confidence interval (CI): 49.4%, 94.2%] in prevalence
      of rotavirus in participants without diarrhoea symptoms and a 46.0% reduction
      (95% CI: 6.2%, 68.9%) in prevalence of rotavirus infection among participants
      experiencing diarrhoea. Whereas all age groups benefited, this reduction was
      strongest among the youngest age groups. For young children, prevalence of
      symptomatic diarrhoea also decreased in the post-vaccine period in both the
      case-control study (reduction in prevalence for children <1 year of age = 69.3%, 
      95% CI: 8.7%, 89.7%) and the cohort study (reduction in hazard for receipt of two
      Rotarix doses among children aged 0.5-2 years = 57.1%, 95% CI: 16.6, 77.9%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Rotarix vaccination may suppress transmission, including
      asymptomatic transmission, in low- and middle-income settings. It was highly
      effective among children in a rural community setting and provides
      population-level benefits through indirect protection among adults.

TI  - NO2 levels after the COVID-19 lockdown in Ecuador: A trade-off between
      environment and human health.
PG  - 100674
LID - 10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100674 [doi]
AB  - The negative effects on human health, along with the fatalities caused by the new
      coronavirus, have led governments worldwide to take strict measures. However, a
      reduction in air pollution has been found in many regions on a global scale. This
      study is focused on how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting on the air quality in 
      Ecuador, one of the most alarming cases of COVID-19 contagion in Latin America,
      occupying the first place as regards deaths per capita. The spatio-temporal
      variations in NO2 concentrations in 12 highly populated cities were evaluated by 
      comparing the NO2 tropospheric concentrations before (2019) and after (2020) the 
      COVID-19 lockdown. The atmospheric data was collected from the TROPOMI on the
      Sentinel-5P satellite of the European Space Agency. A reduction in NO2
      concentrations (-13%) was observed as a consequence of the COVID-19 lockdown in
      Ecuador. However, this reduction occurred to the greatest extent in the cases of 
      Guayaquil (-23.4%) and Quito (-22.4%), the two most highly populated cities.
      Linking NO2 levels to confirmed cases/deaths of COVID-19, a strong correlation
      between air NO2 concentrations and the cases/mortality caused by coronavirus (r =
      0.91; p<0.001) was observed. This work highlights the crucial role played by air 
      quality as regards human health.

TI  - BLIGHTSIM: A New Potato Late Blight Model Simulating the Response of Phytophthora

      Change.
LID - E659 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens9080659 [doi]
AB  - Temperature response curves under diurnal oscillating temperatures differ from
      those under constant conditions for all stages of the Phytophthora infestans
      infection cycle on potatoes. We developed a mechanistic model (BLIGHTSIM) with an
      hourly time step to simulate late blight under fluctuating environmental
      conditions and predict late blight epidemics in potato fields. BLIGHTSIM is a
      modified susceptible (S), latent (L), infectious (I) and removed (R)
      compartmental model with hourly temperature and relative humidity as driving
      variables. The model was calibrated with growth chamber data covering one
      infection cycle and validated with field data from Ecuador. The model provided a 
      good fit to all data sets evaluated. There was a significant interaction between 
      average temperature and amplitude in their effects on the area under the disease 
      progress curve (AUDPC) as predicted from growth chamber data on a single
      infection cycle. BLIGHTSIM can be incorporated in a potato growth model to study 
      effects of diurnal temperature range on late blight impact under climate change
      scenarios.

TI  - Influence of the Maturity Stage on the Phytochemical Composition and the
      Antioxidant Activity of Four Andean Blackberry Cultivars (Rubus glaucus Benth)
      from Ecuador.
LID - E1027 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants9081027 [doi]
AB  - Andean blackberries (Rubus glaucus Benth) are fruits rich in phytocomponents with
      high antioxidant activity. In this work, the changes in the total polyphenol
      content (TPC), the total flavonoid content (TFC), and the total anthocyanin
      content (TAC) of four blackberry varieties at three maturity stages (E1-25%,
      E2-50%, and E3-100%) were measured. The antioxidant activity (AA) was evaluated
      using the 2,2'azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazolin 6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) and ferric
      reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods. TPC and TFC content decreased with the
      increase in the maturity stage. The blackberry Brazos cultivar presented TPC
      values of 51.26, 38.16, and 31.59 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g dry
      weight (DW) at E1, E2, and E3, respectively. The TAC and soluble solids increased
      with the increase in the maturity stage of the fruits. The Andimora variety at E3
      presented a high TPC content, and the Colombiana variety presented a high TFC
      content. The blackberry Colombiana cultivar presented TAC values of 1.40, 2.95,
      and 12.26 mg cy-3-glu/100g DW at E1, E2, and E3, respectively. The blackberry
      Colombiana cultivar presented a high AA value at 1278.63 micromol TE/g DW
      according to the ABTS method and 1284.55 micromol TE/g DW according to the FRAP
      method. The TPC and TFC showed a high correlation with the AA according to the
      ABTS and the FRAP methods. The Pearson correlation between the TFC and AA/ABTS
      has a value of r = 0.92. The TFC and AA/FRAP present a value of r = 0.94.

TI  - Portable Ultrasonography to Assess Adult Hepatosteatosis in Rural Ecuador.
LID - 10.7556/jaoa.2020.095 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Hepatosteatosis (HS) is prevalent worldwide and can be measured via
      ultrasonographic (US) hepatic-renal (H/R) echo-intensity ratio. OBJECTIVE: To
      examine the incidence of HS in rural communities of the Ecuadorian Chimborazo
      region and to validate portable US as an effective method of disease screening in
      rural settings. METHODS: Sagittal right liver/kidney B-mode US was performed in
      individuals from 4 villages using a portable US scanner equipped with a 3.5-MHz
      curvilinear probe. National Institutes of Health ImageJ software was used to
      computerize tissue echogenicity in both renal cortex and hepatic parenchyma
      offline. Regions of interest of 900 pixels were used for measuring pixel
      intensity of the right renal cortex and hepatic parenchyma when calculating the
      H/R ratio. The difference in pixel intensity between liver parenchyma and renal
      cortex was analyzed using an unpaired t test. The intraclass correlation
      coefficient was used to test intra- and interobserver reliability for
      computerizing the H/R ratio. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled in the study
      (32 women and 8 men; mean age, 40 years). The mean (SD) H/R ratio of study
      patients was 3.61 (2.32), moderately higher than normal (normal, H/R <1.5). A
      significant difference was found in mean (SD) pixel value between hepatic
      parenchyma and renal cortex (52.82 [15.34] vs 19.93 [10.39]; P<.001). Thirty-four
      patients (85%) had an H/R ratio greater than 1.5. The intra- and interobserver
      reliability of computerizing H/R ratio was excellent (r=0.940; P<.01).
      CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HS is moderately present in persons in
      remote communities of Ecuador. The mean H/R ratio was greater than that in the
      diagnostic criteria for the disease. Portable US imaging may benefit these
      communities as an efficient method for the HS screening and diagnosis in rural
      areas.

TI  - The genetic characterization of fall armyworm populations in Ecuador and its
      implications to migration and pest management in the northern regions of South
      America.
PG  - e0236759
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0236759 [doi]
AB  - The fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is a moth pest native to the Western
      Hemisphere that has recently become a global problem, invading Africa, Asia, and 
      Australia. The species has a broad host range, long-distance migration
      capability, and a propensity for the generation of pesticide resistance traits
      that make it a formidable invasive threat and a difficult pest to control. While 
      fall armyworm migration has been extensively studied in North America, where
      annual migrations of thousands of kilometers are the norm, migration patterns in 
      South America are less understood. As a first step to address this issue we have 
      been genetically characterizing fall armyworm populations in Ecuador, a country
      in the northern portion of South America that has not been extensively surveyed
      for this pest. These studies confirm and extend past findings indicating
      similarities in the fall armyworm populations from Ecuador, Trinidad-Tobago,
      Peru, and Bolivia that suggest substantial migratory interactions. Specifically, 
      we found that populations throughout Ecuador are genetically homogeneous,
      indicating that the Andes mountain range is not a long-term barrier to fall
      armyworm migration. Quantification of genetic variation in an intron sequence
      describe patterns of similarity between fall armyworm from different locations in
      South America with implications for how migration might be occurring. In
      addition, we unexpectedly found these observations only apply to one subset of
      fall armyworm (the C-strain), as the other group (R-strain) was not present in
      Ecuador. The results suggest differences in migration behavior between fall
      armyworm groups in South America that appear to be related to differences in host
      plant preferences.

TI  - First report of Ralstonia solanacearum causing bacterial wilt of eucalyptus in
      Ecuador.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-11-19-2516-PDN [doi]
AB  - In January 2018, eucalyptus trees showing wilt symptoms were identified in a
      commercial plantation located in the Quevedo Canton, Los Rios province, Ecuador. 
      Disease incidence reached 40% of the eucalyptus field and affected plants
      displayed reddening and wilting of the foliage, leaf drop, branch dieback, and
      reduced growth, resembling bacterial wilting symptoms (Santiago et al., 2014).
      Transverse sections made on trunks of wilted trees revealed vascular
      discoloration of the wood and bacterial ooze. Wood pieces taken from discoloured 
      tissues were surface disinfected and macerated in sterilized distilled water. The
      resulting suspensions were spread on plates containing triphenyltetrazolium
      chloride medium (TZC) (Kelman, 1954) and incubated at 28 degrees C for 48 h.
      Three mucoid white colonies with pinkish centers, characteristic of Ralstonia
      solanacearum, were purified (Figure S1C). The isolates were Gram negative in the 
      KOH test, non-fluorescent on King's B medium, and formed cream colonies on yeat
      extract-dextrose-calcium carbonate (YDC) medium. Phylotype-specific multiplex PCR
      (PMX-PCR) (Fegan and Prior, 2005) and phylogenetic analysis based on partial
      endoglucanase (egl) gene sequences (Poussier et al. 2000) (Figure S2) identified 
      the isolates as R. solanacearum Phylotype IIB sequevar 51. The isolates were
      preserved in the COAD culture collection of the Universidade Federal de Vicosa,
      Brazil (codes COAD 2586, 2587 and 2588) and the corresponding egl DNA sequences
      were deposited in the GenBank (accession numbers MH350031, MH350032 and
      MH350033). Pathogenicity tests were conducted with all three isolates. Twenty
      microliters of bacterial suspensions (108 CFU/mL of saline solution) were
      injected at the base of the stem of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus urograndis), banana
      (Musa sp. cv. Maca) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Santa Clara) plants kept
      in a greenhouse (28 +/- 2 degrees C) (Fonseca et al., 2016). Three plants of each
      host species were inoculated per bacterial isolate and plants injected with
      distilled water were used as controls. Necrotic symptoms appeared at the
      inoculation site on eucalyptus plants after 10 days. Wilt symptoms started at the
      top and progressed towards the base of the plants (Figure S1A). Tomato plants
      died within one week, and eucalyptus seedlings died after three weeks. The
      inoculated banana seedlings and all plants from the control treatments remained
      asymptomatic. Bacterial ooze was observed on freshly-cut transverse sections made
      on wilted eucalyptus seedlings (Figure S1B) and typical colonies of R.
      solanacearum were isolated from inoculated plants, fulfilling Koch's postulates. 
      The correct diagnosis of the pathogen is the first step in the long-term process 
      of developing effective management tools for this disease in Ecuador.

TI  - Molecular screening of cattle ticks, tick-borne pathogens and amitraz resistance 
      in ticks of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas province in Ecuador.

AB  - The province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas in Ecuador is a strategic place
      for cattle production and trade. The lack of knowledge about tick species, tick
      control and tick-borne diseases in Ecuador prompted this study with the goal of
      identifying the cattle-tick species and tick-borne agents present in the area and
      molecularly determining the potential acaricide resistance to amitraz of the
      major cattle tick species. Eighty-four cattle farms were visited and in 88 % of
      them, cattle were infested with ticks. Additionally, 24 historical samples from
      other surrounding Ecuadorian provinces, were screened as well. Besides
      morphological keys, PCR-RFLP MspI was used to confirm the presence of the
      Rhipicephalus ticks. The tick samples were also screened for tick-borne agents
      using PCR-RFLP BseDI and Hhal tests to identify circulating Babesia sp. and
      Anaplasma spp. Furthermore, the PCR-RFLP EciI technique was used to identify the 
      amitraz resistance gene in populations of Rhipicephalus microplus in the
      province. Pooled testing was used to determine prevalence at individual-tick
      level. The presence of R. microplus and Amblyomma cajennense sensu lato (s.l.)
      ticks was found in 83 % and 21 % of the cattle farms respectively, showing R.
      microplus is widespread in the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas.
      Regarding tick-borne agents, only Anaplasma marginale was observed in 50 % of the
      visited farms of the province, while about 27 % of the ticks tested positive
      according to estimations from the data of the tick pools. The presence of Babesia
      bigemina was only confirmed in samples collected outside the province. The
      amitraz resistance allele in R. microplus was found in 62 % of the farms, but the
      percentage of farms with cattle ticks completely resistant to this acaricide was 
      low (2%). The findings of this study should prompt cattle producers and animal
      health authorities to monitor control strategies, which address the management of
      resistant tick populations and the epidemiologically-unstable areas of tick-borne
      diseases.

TI  - Genetic barcoding of Ecuadorian epilithic diatom species suitable as water
      quality bioindicators.
PG  - 41-52
LID - 10.5802/crbiol.2 [doi]
AB  - Diatom identification is a key step in using these microorganisms as water
      quality bioindicators. Morphological diagnosis is a difficult task due to the
      enormous number of species and their microscopic size. This can be overcome using
      molecular tools to complement the diagnosis. The main goal of this work was to
      obtain the DNA barcode of Ecuadorian epilithic diatoms with a wide geographical
      distribution, a well-defined ecological range and characteristics that allow them
      to be reliable indicator species. Unialgal diatom cultures were obtained from
      environmental samples of Ecuadorian Andean streams. Morphological
      characterization of cultures was carried out under SEM microscopy. For molecular 
      characterization, 18SV4 and rbcL barcodes were sequenced from each strain and
      blasted against a GenBank database. A phylogenetic tree for each barcode was
      constructed using the ML method including sequences of strains of the studied
      species from different geographical locations. The results showed the following
      five species to be suitable as bioindicators and these were isolated. Sellaphora 
      seminulum (strain JA01b, c), Nitzschia fonticola (strain SP02a) and N. palea
      (strain CA01a) are tolerant to eutrophication; Eolimna minima (strain CH02a) is a
      mesotrophic water bioindicator, and Achnanthidium minutissimum (strain JA01a) is 
      an oligotrophic water bioindicator. The comparison with the GenBank database of
      the barcoding regions supported the morphological identification. The barcoding
      sequences of the strains showed a high percentage of identity with the sequences 
      reported in INSDC databases for the same species. The topology of the
      phylogenetic trees demonstrates that epilithic diatoms from Ecuador are closely
      related to those of same species isolated from other geographical regions. This
      study is a first attempt to establish a morphological and molecular taxonomic
      reference library for neotropical diatoms. This study demonstrates that it would 
      be feasible to use the existing barcoding data for diatoms to develop molecular
      tools for the bioassessment of aquatic ecosystems in the Ecuadorian Andean
      region.

TI  - Effect of Mineral Supplementation on the Macromineral Concentration in Blood in
      Pre- and Postpartum Blackbelly Sheep.
LID - E1206 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani10071206 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of mineral
      supplementation on the serum concentration of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium 
      in pre- and postpartum Blackbelly sheep throughout three successive lambing
      periods under free grazing conditions in the Ecuadorian Amazon Region. The field 
      work was carried out between January 2015 and February 2018 using 20 Blackbelly
      sheep belonging to the Centre for Research, Postgraduate Studies and Conservation
      of Amazon Biodiversity, Ecuador. The flock was randomly divided into two groups: 
      Group 1 (G1) was fed with forage plus a supplementation (Pecutrin((R)) Mineral
      supplement plus vitamins A, D3, and E. Bayer HealthCare) and Group 2 (G2) was fed
      only with forage without mineral supplementation. Three blood samples from the
      coccygeal vein were taken from each sheep 30 days before lambing, 30 days after, 
      and 60 days after lambing. Concerning the average of calcium, significant
      differences were found at different times inside each group and also between them
      (p < 0.0001 in both cases). As for the phosphorus, significant differences were
      found between the means of the groups for all times from 30 days after the second
      lambing season (p < 0.05). It was observed that the groups differed significantly
      in terms on the average of magnesium (considering a significance level of 0.05)
      30 days before the first lambing and at all times measured from the 30 days after
      the second lambing (p < 0.005). In this study, we showed that Blackbelly sheep
      raised under free grazing conditions in the Ecuadorian Amazon Region had very low
      serum calcium values, and supplementation was unable to improve them. Meanwhile, 
      phosphorus and magnesium levels were below the required values, but after
      supplementation, they exceeded the minimum threshold. Mineral supplementation in 
      the rearing of sheep in grazing systems is necessary during the entire production
      cycle, but it must be done taking into account the soil-plant-animal relationship
      specifically for the Amazonian Region systems.

TI  - Chemical and Enantioselective Analysis of the Leaf Essential Oil from Piper
      coruscans Kunth (Piperaceae), a Costal and Amazonian Native Species of Ecuador.
LID - E791 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants9060791 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, an essential oil was distilled from the leaves of Piper
      coruscans Kunth, a native Amazonian species belonging to the family Piperaceae
      and quite common in Ecuador. The chemical analysis was performed by GC-MS
      (qualitative) and GC-FID (quantitative), on polar and non-polar columns,
      detecting a total of 58 compounds of which 52 were identified. All the identified
      compounds were quantified. The essential oil was mainly constituted of
      sesquiterpenes (54.1-55.0%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (32.5-33.6%), the
      major constituents being: (E)-beta-caryophyllene (24.1-25.0%), alpha-humulene
      (11.6-12.0%), caryophyllene oxide (9.3-10.9%), linalool (4.5-5.2%), humulene
      epoxide II (3.6-4.1%), (E)-nerolidol (3.7-4.0%), alpha-copaene (3.7-3.9%),
      alpha-muurolol (3.4-3.7%), alpha-selinene (3.4-3.5%), beta-selinene (3.1-3.3%),
      and one undetermined oxygenated sesquiterpenoid (3.1-3.3%). The aqueous phase
      (hydrolate) of the distillation process was also submitted to chemical analysis, 
      showing linalool as the main organic compound in solution, with a concentration
      of 12.3-15.7 mg/100 mL. The essential oil was than analyzed for the enantiomeric 
      distribution of its monoterpene constituents, affording the following
      enantiomeric excesses in two beta-cyclodextrin-based enantioselective columns:
      (1S,5S)-(-)-alpha-pinene (60.0-69.6%), (1S,5S)-(-)-beta-pinene (5.2-7.2%),
      (R)-(-)-alpha-phellandrene (72.5-78.2%), (R)-(+)-limonene (28.6%) and
      (R)-(-)-linalool (1.8-3.1%).

TI  - Biomass yield and carbon abatement potential of banana crops (Musa spp.) in
      Ecuador.
PG  - 18741-18753
LID - 10.1007/s11356-020-09755-4 [doi]
AB  - Banana is one of the most important agricultural products of Ecuador. It relies
      on intensive monoculture cropping systems with a large volume of standing biomass
      and large amounts of residual biomass that can be used for carbon sequestration. 
      This study was performed (1) to quantify the yearly residual biomass generation, 
      (2) to quantify the carbon stock of standing banana biomass, (3) to estimate the 
      carbon sequestration potential by using the residual biomass generated yearly,
      and (4) to propose a biomass prediction model for banana crops in Ecuador. The
      study was conducted between March 2018 and January 2019 in the three main
      banana-producing provinces of Ecuador (Los Rios, Guayas, and El Oro). Samples of 
      rachis, pseudostem, leaves, and flowers from 36 banana plants of the variety Musa
      AAA Cavendish were taken for laboratory tests. Physical measurements such as
      height, circumferences, number of leaves, and weights were determined for the 36 
      plants. Results showed an average residue-to-product ratio of 3.79 and a
      country's yearly biomass generation of 2.65 Mt on a dry basis. The carbon stock
      of the standing biomass was estimated as 4.18 +/- 1.02 Mg/ha, 5.44 +/- 0.96
      Mg/ha, and 5.13 +/- 1.11 Mg/ha for Los Rios, Guayas, and El Oro, respectively.
      The estimated carbon abatement capacity of the residual biomass is 3.92
      MtCO2/year. Three biomass estimation models were developed in Python(R), using
      the data collected in this study and least squares fitting for exponential models
      of the form: Y = AX(n) + C. The models showed good prediction capacity for
      Ecuadorian banana plants, with R(2) up to 0.85. It is expected that this study
      could serve as the basis for studies on developing sustainable conversion
      processes of banana residual biomass.

AB  - Biomass is an important indicator of various ecological factors in insect
      populations and communities. Although the utility of this variable is proven, it 
      is usually dismissed in ecological studies, generally, because of the difficulty 
      of measuring it. Considering that insect biomass is apparently declining
      worldwide, here, we aimed to test the accuracy of forewing length as an estimator
      of body mass in Neotropical Ichneumonidae to help in monitoring insect biomass.
      Forewing length and dry body mass were measured in 728 individuals from distinct 
      localities in Venezuela and Ecuador. A clear log-linear relationship existed
      between the two variables, and a log-linear regression had significant and strong
      predictive power of mass based on wing length. To derive the final values of mass
      from predictions made using our equation, we used an exponential transformation. 
      We present an R function for predicting mass from wing length. We consider our
      findings applicable to many Neotropical species of Ichneumonidae, and helpful
      especially when specimens are measured in dry collections.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop norms for two
      neuropsychological tests of learning and memory in an Ecuadorian adult
      population. METHOD: 322 healthy individuals, ages between 18 and 84, were
      enrolled in the Metropolitan District of Quito. Participants were administered a 
      comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation that included tests of learning and
      memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test [ROCF] and Hopkins Verbal Learning
      Test-Revised [HVLT-R]). Backward stepwise multiple linear regression analyses
      were used to examine the influence of demographic variables age, education, and
      gender on test performance. Normative data were developed adjusting for
      demographic variables found to be significant in the final regression models.
      RESULTS: The final multiple linear models revealed performance on tests of
      learning and memory worsened with age and improved as a function of education. A 
      user-friendly Excel-based calculator is presented to calculate the z score and
      percentile automatically based on raw score and sociodemographic information.
      CONCLUSION: This is the first study that presents normative data for tests of
      learning and memory for an adult population in Ecuador. It is expected that these
      norms will help to improve the clinical practice of neuropsychology in Ecuador by
      limiting erroneous raw score interpretation and incrementing diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - Assessing the burden and spatial distribution of Taenia solium human
      neurocysticercosis in Ecuador (2013-2017).
PG  - e0008384
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008384 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimating the burden of neglected tropical diseases is a valuable
      tool to support policymakers in the resource allocation for control and
      elimination of these diseases. Spatial analysis allows to identify the
      geographical distribution patterns of infectious and parasitic diseases within a 
      country and allows to assess their possible correlation with other health
      disorders. Despite being neurocysticercosis (NCC) considered as the most
      important parasitic disease of the nervous system, few efforts have been
      addressed to assess the real burden of NCC in endemic countries, to date, there
      are no studies estimating the burden of NCC in South America. In this study we
      aimed to use the Disability Adjust Life Years (DALY) and spatial indicators as
      tools to measure the impact of human neurocysticercosis in Ecuador between 2013
      and 2017. METHODS: Mortality, morbidity and spatial data from the national agency
      of statistics were used to estimate the burden of disease of NCC during a
      five-year period (2013-2017). NCC cases and its two main sequelae, epilepsy and
      migraine headache, were stratified by sex and age group to calculate the DALY
      associated to NCC using the DALY package in R. SATSCAN software was used to
      assess spatial clusters of NCC and its possible neurological sequelae as
      epilepsy, status epilepticus, migraine and hydrocephalus. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The
      burden of human neurocysticercosis ranged from 56201 [95% CI 29961-89333] to
      59612 [95% CI 31854-94689] DALY per year, corresponding to 3.54 to 3.56 DALY per 
      1000 population. Average yearly incidence rates per 10 000 person-years were 0.23
      [95% CI 0.21-0.26] for NCC, 4.89 [95% CI 4.78-5.00] for epilepsy, 0.130 [95% CI
      0.11-0.15] for status epilepticus, 0.62 [95% CI 0.58-0.66] for migraine headache,
      and 1.02 [95% CI 0.98-1.07] for hydrocephalus. Most important significant spatial
      clusters (p<0.0001) were located in the southern region of the highlands of the
      country. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study in South America to
      calculate estimates for burden of NCC and one of the few using spatial analysis
      to show the importance of sequelae other than epilepsy that play an important
      role in the impact of human neurocysticercosis.

TI  - Would tropical climatic variations impact the genetic variability of triatomines:
      Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, principal vector of Chagas disease in Ecuador?

AB  - Rhodnius ecuadoriensis is one of the most important vector species of Chagas
      disease in Ecuador. This species is distributed in the Central coast region and
      in the south Andean region, and an incipient speciation process between these
      geographical populations was previously proposed. The current population genetics
      study only focused on the Central coast region and analyzed 96 sylvatic specimens
      of R. ecuadoriensis associated with Phytelephas aequatorialis palm trees. We used
      Cytb and 16S-rRNA sequences and a Cytb-16S-rRNA concatenated set to explore (i)
      the genetic variability, spatial structuring, and demographic history of R.
      ecuadoriensis, and to determine (ii) the relationship between the genetic and
      climatic variabilities. A particularly high genetic variability was observed
      without detectable general genetic structure; only some terminal genetic clusters
      were observed. We did not observe isolation by geographical distance (IBD), and
      it is likely that ancient expansion occurred, according to Fs index and mismatch 
      distribution for Cytb-16S-rRNA concatenated sequences. Hierarchical clustering
      showed that the current locality origins of the bugs were grouped into four
      bioclimatic clusters. Genetic and bioclimatic distances were not correlated, but 
      some genetic clusters were associated with bioclimatic ones. The results showed
      an ancient evolution of the species in the region with a possible old expansion. 
      The absence of spatial genetic structure could be due to climatic conditions
      (possible selection of singular genotypes) and to passive transportation of palms
      tree materials where R. ecuadoriensis are living.

AB  - Real-time identification of wildlife is an upcoming and promising tool for the
      preservation of wildlife. In this research project, we aimed to use object
      detection and image classification for the racer snakes of the Galapagos Islands,
      Ecuador. The final target of this project was to build an artificial intelligence
      (AI) platform, in terms of a web or mobile application, which would serve as a
      real-time decision making and supporting mechanism for the visitors and park
      rangers of the Galapagos Islands, to correctly identify a snake species from the 
      user's uploaded image. Using the deep learning and machine learning algorithms
      and libraries, we modified and successfully implemented four region-based
      convolutional neural network (R-CNN) architectures (models for image
      classification): Inception V2, ResNet, MobileNet, and VGG16. Inception V2, ResNet
      and VGG16 reached an overall accuracy of 75%.

TI  - US Evaluation of Bone Age in Rural Ecuadorian Children: Association with
      Anthropometry and Nutrition.
PG  - 161-169
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2020190606 [doi]
AB  - Background Stunted growth and development is a serious global public health
      problem. A limited number of field measures exist that can be used to evaluate
      stunting and its underlying biologic mechanisms. Purpose To assess bone age using
      tablet-based US in young children living in a rural community in Ecuador, where
      stunting is prevalent, and to evaluate the associations between bone age,
      anthropometry, and diet. Materials and Methods From June through August 2017,
      tablet-based US was used to assess bone age in young children within their homes 
      in rural Cotopaxi, Ecuador. Bone age z scores (BAZs) were assigned using the
      standards of Greulich and Pyle. Anthropometric data were collected using
      international protocols; z scores were generated from World Health Organization
      Child Growth Standards. Groups were compared using the Student t test. Univariate
      analyses and generalized linear regression modeling were applied to test the
      association between bone age and anthropometry, adjusting for covariates
      including age, sex, dietary intake, and morbidities. Results A total of 128
      children (mean age, 33.9 months +/- 1.8 [standard deviation]; 59 girls, 69 boys) 
      were evaluated. Mean BAZ was -1.20 +/- 1.16. Mean BAZ was lower in children with 
      stunted growth (-1.42 +/- 1.18) than in children without stunted growth (-0.98
      +/- 1.10, P = .04). In adjusted analysis, BAZ was associated with the following
      variables: height-for-age z score (beta coefficient, 0.26; 95% confidence
      interval [CI]: 0.05, 0.46; P = .01), female sex (beta coefficient, 0.51; 95% CI: 
      0.15, 0.88; P = .006), number of times eggs were consumed in the previous 24
      hours (beta coefficient, 0.22; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.38; P = .009), number of times
      savory or salty snacks were consumed in the previous 24 hours (beta coefficient, 
      0.42; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.68; P = .002), and ownership of pig livestock, which was a 
      binary variable (beta coefficient, -0.46; 95% CI: -0.82, -0.09; P = .01).
      Conclusion Bone age determined using tablet-based US was lower in children who
      had stunted growth and was associated with diet in a cohort of children living in
      rural Ecuador. (c) RSNA, 2020 See also the editorial by Dillman and Ayyala in

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that is considered an important
      public health problem in tropical regions and the world's poorest countries.
      METHODS: In this ecological study, we included cases of leptospirosis reported in
      Ecuador from 2013 to 2018. Spatial autocorrelation was evaluated through the
      global Moran I index and spatial-temporal scan statistics were used to identify
      high-risk clusters. RESULTS: In Ecuador, the leptospirosis incidence rates
      decreased from 3.3 cases per 100 000 population in 2013 to 0.8 cases per 100 000 
      population in 2018. The global Moran I index for the study period showed a
      positive spatial autocorrelation (0.68; p=0.001). We identified three significant
      spatial-temporal clusters for a high occurrence of leptospirosis incidence
      located in cantons of the Coast and Amazon regions. CONCLUSIONS: The clusters
      identified could be targeted by policymakers and stakeholders in order to direct 
      surveillance and understand the dynamics of the distribution of leptospirosis in 
      Ecuador.

TI  - Sarcophagid Myiasis in the Bufonid Rhinella alata in Panama.
PG  - 667-672
LID - 10.7589/2018-05-121 [doi]
AB  - Rhinella alata is a small terrestrial bufonid that occurs in Ecuador, Colombia,
      and Panama. Between January 2014 and October 2015, we inspected 339 R. alata from
      Panama and report myiasis in eight of these toads. All infested toads were male
      and presented with mobile dark fly larvae visible beneath the ventral skin. At
      necropsy, we identified the larvae as belonging to the family Sarcophagidae
      (flesh flies). Flesh flies have been variously considered as predators,
      parasitoids, and parasites of anurans. There are at least four species of flesh
      flies that infect adult amphibians in the Neotropics, with the most common and
      widespread being Lepidodexia bufonivora. Myiasis has only rarely been reported in
      Panamanian anurans. Anuran cases of sarcophagid myiasis are usually fatal and we 
      suspect myiasis as the cause of death for the R. alata that died in the current
      study.

TI  - The Latin American experience with a next generation sequencing genetic panel for
      recessive limb-girdle muscular weakness and Pompe disease.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/s13023-019-1291-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a group of neuromuscular
      disorders of heterogeneous genetic etiology with more than 30 directly related
      genes. LGMD is characterized by progressive muscle weakness involving the
      shoulder and pelvic girdles. An important differential diagnosis among patients
      presenting with proximal muscle weakness (PMW) is late-onset Pompe disease
      (LOPD), a rare neuromuscular glycogen storage disorder, which often presents with
      early respiratory insufficiency in addition to PMW. Patients with PMW, with or
      without respiratory symptoms, were included in this study of Latin American
      patients to evaluate the profile of variants for the included genes related to
      LGMD recessive (R) and LOPD and the frequency of variants in each gene among this
      patient population. RESULTS: Over 20 institutions across Latin America (Brazil,
      Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, and Chile) enrolled 2103 individuals during
      2016 and 2017. Nine autosomal recessive LGMDs and Pompe disease were investigated
      in a 10-gene panel (ANO5, CAPN3, DYSF, FKRP, GAA, SGCA, SGCB, SGCD, SGCG, TCAP)
      based on reported disease frequency in Latin America. Sequencing was performed
      with Illumina's NextSeq500 and variants were classified according to ACMG
      guidelines; pathogenic and likely pathogenic were treated as one category (P) and
      variants of unknown significance (VUS) are described. Genetic variants were
      identified in 55.8% of patients, with 16% receiving a definitive molecular
      diagnosis; 39.8% had VUS. Nine patients were identified with Pompe disease.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this targeted genetic
      panel and the importance of including Pompe disease in the differential diagnosis
      for patients presenting with PMW.

AB  - This study is part of a larger project to generate norms for letter verbal
      fluency test (VFT) in 3,284 children from nine Latin American countries. The
      letter VFT (letters M, R, and P) was administered and multiple linear
      regressions, including age, age(2), MPE (mean parental education), MPE(2), sex,
      and interactions were used as predictors. Results showed significant differences 
      across countries for all scores. Age affected scores linearly except for Ecuador 
      (P-letter), in which a quadratic effect was found. Scores increased linearly as a
      function of MPE, with the exception of Mexico (R-letter), in which a quadratic
      effect was found. Age by MPE (M- and P-letters), and age by MPE(2) (R-letter)
      interactions were found in Mexico. Sex had an impact on letter R in Cuba, and
      letter P in Ecuador and Paraguay. Age(2) by sex interaction was found in Ecuador 
      (P-letter). These norms will be useful for clinical neuropsychologists in these
      countries to evaluate their patients' verbal fluency.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determine the incidence of loss to follow-up (LTFU) in patients
      treated for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) or multidrug-resistant
      tuberculosis (RR/MDR-TB), and the factors associated with this discharge status
      in Ecuador. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients with RR/MDR-TB who
      followed the World Health Organization's 18-24-month treatment regimen in 2014
      and 2015, as reported by the Ministry of Health of Ecuador. The incidence of LTFU
      was determined, and clinical and epidemiological manifestations of cases
      discharged as LTFU were compared with those discharged as successfully treated.
      Survival was analyzed with Cox regression in order to evaluate factors associated
      with LTFU. RESULTS: Of 328 cases, 270 (82.3%) were analyzed because they had a
      reported discharge status. Discharge as LTFU accounted for 39.6% of cases, and as
      successfully treated, 50.4%. The risk factors associated with LTFU were: previous
      discharge as LTFU in a previous TB episode [hazard ratio (HR): 2.96 (1.53-5.73), 
      P < 0.001]; addiction to alcohol or drugs [HR: 2.82 (1.10-7.23), P = 0.031]; and 
      having an Xpert((R)) diagnosis (TB-RR) [HR: 1.53 (1.0-2.35), P = 0.048]. Of the
      total LTFU, 43% occurred after nine months of treatment. CONCLUSION: The
      incidence of LTFU in patients with RR/MDR-TB in Ecuador is above the average for 
      the Region of the Americas. The three identified factors support implementation
      of shorter regimens and patient-centered care, in line with the End TB Strategy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Latin American (LA) region is still facing an ongoing
      epidemiological transition and shows a complex public health scenario regarding
      non-communicable diseases (NCDs). A healthy diet and consumption of specific food
      groups may decrease the risk of NCDs, however there is a lack of dietary intake
      data in LA countries. OBJECTIVE: Provide updated data on the dietary intake of
      key science-based selected food groups related to NCDs risk in LA countries.
      DESIGN: ELANS (Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health) is a multicenter
      cross-sectional study assessing food consumption from an urban sample between15
      to 65 years old from 8 LA countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa
      Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela). Two 24-HR were obtained from 9,218
      individuals. The daily intake of 10 food groups related to NCDs risk (fruits;
      vegetables; legumes/beans; nuts and seeds; whole grains products; fish and
      seafood; yogurt; red meat; processed meats; sugar-sweetened beverages
      (ready-to-drink and homemade)) were assessed and compared to global
      recommendations. RESULTS: Only 7.2% of the overall sample reached WHO's
      recommendation for fruits and vegetables consumption (400 grams per day).
      Regarding the dietary patterns related to a reduced risk of NCDs, among the
      overall sample legumes and fruits were the food groups with closer intake to the 
      recommendation, although much lower than expected (13.1% and 11.5%,
      respectively). Less than 3.5% of the sample met the optimal consumption level of 
      vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish and yogurt. Largest country-dependent
      differences in average daily consumption were found for legumes, nuts, fish, and 
      yogurt. Mean consumption of SSB showed large differences between countries.
      CONCLUSION: Diet intake quality is deficient for nutrient-dense food groups,
      suggesting a higher risk for NCDs in the urban LA region in upcoming decades.
      These data provide relevant and up-to-date information to take urgent public
      health actions to improve consumption of critically foods in order to prevent
      NCDs.

AB  - The growth of urbanization worldwide has contributed to the deterioration of the 
      ecological status of water bodies. Efforts at improving the ecological status
      have been made either in isolated form or by means of integrated measures by
      stakeholders, but in many cases, these measures have not been evaluated to
      determine their benefit. In this study, we implemented a scenario analysis to
      restore the ecological water quality in the Cuenca River and its tributaries,
      which are located in the southern Andes of Ecuador. For this analysis, an
      integrated ecological model (IEM) was developed. The IEM linked an urban
      wastewater system (IUWS) model, which gave satisfactory results in its
      calibration and validation processes, with ecological models. The IUWS is a
      mechanistic model that incorporated the river water quality model, a wastewater
      treatment plant (WWTP) with activated sludge technology, and discharges from the 
      sewage system. The ecological status of the waterways was evaluated with the
      Andean Biotic Index (ABI), which was predicted using generalized linear models
      (GLMs). The GLMs were calculated with physicochemical results from the IUWS
      model. Four scenarios that would enhance the current ecological water quality
      were analyzed. In these scenarios, the inclusion of a new WWTP with carbon, and
      with carbon and nitrogen removal as well as the addition of retention tanks
      before the discharges of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) were assessed. The new
      WWTP with carbon and nitrogen removal would bring about a better restoration of
      the ecological water quality due to better nitrogen removal. The retention tanks 
      would help to enhance the ecological status of the rivers during rainy seasons.
      The integrated model implemented in this study was shown to be an essential tool 
      to support decisions in the Cuenca River basin management.

AB  - Interest in atmosphere-surface flux modeling over the mountainous regions of the 
      globe has increased recently, with a major focus on the prediction of water,
      carbon and other functional indicators in natural and disturbed conditions.
      However, less research has been centered on exploring energy fluxes (net
      radiation; sensible, latent and soil heat) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa)
      over the Neotropical Andean biome of the paramo. The present study assesses the
      implementation and parameterization of a state-of-art Land-Surface Model (LSM)
      for simulation of these fluxes over two representative paramo catchments of
      southern Ecuador. We evaluated the outputs of the LSM Community Land Model (CLM
      ver. 4.0) with (i) ground-level flux observations from the first (and highest)
      Eddy Covariance (EC) tower of the Northern Andean paramos; (ii) spatial ETa
      estimates from the energy balance-based model METRIC (based on Landsat imagery); 
      and (iii) derived ETa from the closure of the water balance (WB). CLM's energy
      predictions revealed a significant underestimation on net radiation, which
      impacts the sensible and soil heat fluxes (underestimation), and delivers a
      slight overestimation on latent heat flux. Modeled CLM ETa showed acceptable
      goodness-of-fit (Pearson R = 0.82) comparable to ETa from METRIC (R = 0.83).
      Contrarily, a poor performance of ETa WB was observed (R = 0.46). These findings 
      provide solid evidence on the CLM's accuracy for the ETa modeling, and give
      insights in the selection of other ETa methods. The study contributes to a better
      understanding of ecosystem functioning in terms of water loss through evaporative
      processes, and might help in the development of future LSMs' implementations
      focused on climate / land use change scenarios for the paramo.

TI  - Effectiveness of water-saving technologies during early stages of restoration of 
      endemic Opuntia cacti in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.

AB  - Restoration of keystone species is a primary strategy used to combat biodiversity
      loss and recover ecological services. This is particularly true for oceanic
      islands, which despite their small land mass, host a large fraction of the
      planet's imperiled species. The endemic Opuntia spp. cacti are one example and a 
      major focus for restoration in the Galapagos archipelago, Ecuador. These cacti
      are keystone species that support much of the unique vertebrate animal community 
      in arid zones, yet human activities have substantially reduced Opuntia
      populations. Extreme aridity poses an obstacle for quickly restoring Opuntia
      populations though water-saving technologies may provide a solution. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate current restoration efforts and the utility of two
      water-saving technologies as tools for the early stages of restoring Opuntia
      populations in the Galapagos archipelago. We planted 1,425 seedlings between 2013
      and 2018, of which 66% had survived by the end of 2018. Compared with
      no-technology controls, seedlings planted with Groasis Waterboxx((R))
      water-saving technology (polypropylene trays with water reservoir and protective 
      refuge for germinants) had a greater rate of survival in their first two-years of
      growth on one island (Plaza Sur) and greater growth rate on four islands whereas 
      the "Cocoon" water-saving technology (similar technology but made of
      biodegradable fiber) did not affect growth and actually reduced seedling
      survival. Survival and growth rate were also influenced by vegetation zone,
      elevation, and precipitation in ways largely contingent on island. Overall, our
      findings suggest that water-saving technologies are not always universally
      applicable but can substantially increase the survival and growth rate of
      seedlings in certain conditions, providing in some circumstances a useful tool
      for improving restoration outcomes for rare plants of arid ecosystems.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: While the link between childhood experiences of physical, emotional, 
      and sexual abuse and mental health problems has been largely studied, there is
      limited information regarding the prevalence of child maltreatment in developing 
      countries, particularly in South America. The present study is an effort to
      investigate the prevalence of child maltreatment in Ecuador using the ISPCAN
      Child Abuse Screening Tool Retrospective version (ICAST-R). METHOD: A student
      sample (males=1579; females=1554) from the seven largest universities in Quito,
      Ecuador, completed the ICAST-R. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that 69.6 % of
      participants experienced child maltreatment. Physical abuse was reported by 47.6 
      % of respondents; this commonly involved being beaten by parents. Emotional
      maltreatment was reported by 53 % of the participants; mostly through insults by 
      same-sex peers and parents. Sexual abuse was reported by 15.5 % of the
      participants. The most prevalent forms of sexual abuse included being coerced
      into touching another person's genitals, having their genitals touched by others,
      or having someone expose their genitals to them. Sexual abuse was more prevalent 
      amongst females (males=12.9 %; females=18.1 %, OR=1.49; CI=1.22-1.81), and
      physical abuse was more prevalent amongst males (males=50.5 %; females=44.6 %,
      OR=0.79; CI=0.69-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows evidence of a high
      prevalence of child maltreatment in Ecuador. We also identify significant gender 
      differences in the type of abuse experienced, and in the context in which this
      abuse takes place. These results are important given the negative consequences of
      child maltreatment. More research applying ICAST to different populations is
      recommended to further validate the present findings and facilitate international
      comparisons.

PG  - zootaxa.4560.3.7
LID - 10.11646/zootaxa.4560.3.7 [doi]
AB  - Different authors have suggested that Anabates pulvericolor Sclater, 1858 might
      be the valid nomen for Synallaxis propinqua Pelzeln, 1859 or for Synallaxis
      gujanensis huallagae Cory, 1919. However, due to doubts regarding the taxonomic
      identity of Anabates pulvericolor Sclater, 1858, of which the unique type is
      lost, neither of these nomina has been displaced by the senior nomen
      pulvericolor. Our analysis of the case reveals that Anabates pulvericolor
      Sclater, 1858 is correctly identifiable with Synallaxis gujanensis huallagae
      Cory, 1919, of which it is a senior subjective synonym. According to the Code,
      the senior subjective synonym Synallaxis gujanensis pulvericolor (Sclater, 1858) 
      should be adopted. Given the fact that the holotype of Anabates pulvericolor
      Sclater, 1858 is missing and that it has been impossible to identify it from its 
      description until now, we designate a neotype from"Rio Napo, Ecuador", its
      original type locality.

TI  - Cadmium isotope fractionation in the soil - cacao systems of Ecuador: a pilot
      field study.
PG  - 34011-34022
LID - 10.1039/c9ra05516a [doi]
AB  - The often high Cd concentrations of cacao beans are a serious concern for
      producers in Latin America due to the implementation of stricter Cd limits for
      cocoa products by the European Union in 2019. This is the first investigation to 
      employ coupled Cd isotope and concentration measurements to study soil - cacao
      systems. Analyses were carried out for 29 samples of soils, soil amendments and
      cacao tree organs from organic farms in Ecuador that harvest three distinct cacao
      cultivars. The majority of soils from 0-80 cm depth have very similar
      delta(114/110)Cd of about -0.1 per thousand to 0 per thousand. Two 0-5 cm
      topsoils, however, have high Cd concentrations coupled with heavy Cd isotope
      compositions of delta(114/110)Cd approximately 0.2%, possibly indicating Cd
      additions from the tree litter used as organic fertilizer. Whilst cacao leaves,
      pods and beans are ubiquitously enriched in Cd relative to soils there are
      distinct Cd isotope signatures. The leaves and pods are isotopically heavier than
      the soils, with similar Delta(114/110)Cdleaf-soil values of 0.22 +/- 0.07 per
      thousand to 0.41 +/- 0.09 per thousand. In contrast, the data reveal differences 
      in Delta(114/110)Cdbean-leaf that may be linked to distinct cacao cultivars. In
      detail, Delta(114/110)Cdbean-leaf values of -0.34 per thousand to -0.40 per
      thousand were obtained for Nacional cacao from two farms, whilst CCN-51 hybrid
      cacao from a third farm showed no fractionation within error (-0.08 +/- 0.13 per 
      thousand). As such, further work to investigate whether Cd isotopes are indeed
      useful for tracing sources of Cd enrichments in soils and to inform genetic
      efforts to reduce the Cd burden of cocoa is indicated.

TI  - Effects of Aqueous Extracts from Amazon Plants on Plutella xylostella
      (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) and Brevicoryne brassicae (Homoptera: Aphididae) in
      Laboratory, Semifield, and field trials.

AB  - We evaluated the insecticide activities of aqueous extracts of five species of
      plants from the Ecuadorian Amazon (Deguelia utilis (ACSm.) AMGAZEVEDO
      (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae), Xanthosoma purpuratum K. Krause (Alismatales:
      Araceae), Clibadium sp. (Asteracea: Asterales), Witheringia solanacea L'Her
      (Solanales: Solanaceae), and Dieffenbachia costata H. Karst. ex Schott
      (Alismatales: Araceae)) plus Cymbopogon citratus Stapf. (Poales: Poaceae) under
      laboratory, open-field conditions in Plutella xylostella L. (diamondback moth),
      and semifield conditions in Brevicoryne brassicae L. Tap water was used as a
      negative control, and synthetic insecticides were used as positive controls. In a
      laboratory bioassay, aqueous extracts of D. utilis resulted in P. xylostella
      larval mortality. In contrast to chlorpyrifos, all botanicals were oviposition
      deterrents. All extracts except Clibadium sp. decreased leaf consumption by P.
      xylostella larvae. In semifield experiments, D. utilis, Clibadium sp., D.
      costata, and X. purpuratum initially controlled the population of B. brassicae,
      but 7 d after application, all botanicals except the D. utilis lost their ability
      to control the pest. In field experiments on broccoli crops in both dry and rainy
      seasons, the extracts did not control the abundance of P. xylostella, where as a 
      mixture of two insecticides (chlorpyrifos + lambda cyhalothrin) did. These
      results show some incongruences from laboratory to semifield and field
      conditions, indicating that more studies, including the identification of the
      chemicals responsible for the biological activity, its stability, and the effects
      of chemotypes on insecticidal activity, are needed to understand the potential of
      these plant species as botanical insecticides.

TI  - Trees of Amazonian Ecuador: a taxonomically verified species list with data on
      abundance and distribution.
PG  - e02894
LID - 10.1002/ecy.2894 [doi]
AB  - We compiled a data set for all tree species collected to date in lowland
      Amazonian Ecuador in order to determine the number of tree species in the region.
      This data set has been extensively verified by taxonomists and is the most
      comprehensive attempt to evaluate the tree diversity in one of the richest
      species regions of the Amazon. We used four main sources of data: mounted
      specimens deposited in Ecuadorian herbaria only, specimen records of a
      large-scale 1-hectare-plot network (60 plots in total), data from the Missouri
      Botanical Garden Tropicos(R) database (MO), and literature sources. The list of
      2,296 tree species names we provide in this data set is based on 47,486 herbarium
      records deposited in the following herbaria: Alfredo Paredes Herbarium (QAP),
      Catholic University Herbarium (QCA), Herbario Nacional del Ecuador (QCNE),
      Missouri Botanical Garden (MO), and records from an extensive sampling of 29,768 
      individuals with diameter at breast height (dbh) >/=10 cm recorded in our plot
      network. We also provide data for the relative abundance of species, geographic
      coordinates of specimens deposited in major herbaria around the world, whether
      the species is native or endemic, current hypothesis of geographic distribution, 
      representative collections, and IUCN threat category for every species recorded
      to date in Amazonian Ecuador. These data are described in Metadata S1 and can be 
      used for macroecological, evolutionary, or taxonomic studies. There are no
      copyright restrictions; data are freely available for noncommercial scientific
      use (CC BY 3.0). Please see Metadata S1 (Class III, Section B.1: Proprietary
      restrictions) for additional information on usage.

AB  - The study of mosquitoes is important in the prevention of vector-borne diseases. 
      In Ecuador, the study of local mosquito biodiversity was pioneered by two
      entomologists whose contributions span through the first half of the 20th
      century, Francisco Campos-Rivadeneira and Roberto Levi-Castillo. Both of them
      contributed to general aspects of Entomology and to particular insights in
      mosquito taxonomy. Their publications and discoveries were recognized by the
      international scientific community but went unnoticed in South America during
      their time. Today, very few citizens remember the names and contributions of
      these two scientists. Here, we provide an overview of their lives, a summary of
      their contributions, and we conclude with a broader outlook on the practice of
      science in Latin America during their time.

      in Ecuador, 2014-2017
PG  - 370-384
LID - 10.7705/biomedica.v39i3.4387 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a serious public health problem and 
      is widely distributed in the country. When the parasite infects the snails, it
      becomes deeply embedded in their interior and accidentally, it can infect people 
      and other mammals. Objective: To establish the geographical distribution of A.
      cantonensis intermediate hosts (Achatina fulica) and definitive hosts (Rattus
      spp.) in Ecuador from 2014 to 2017. Materials and methods: We collected 2,908 A. 
      fulica specimens in 16 provinces using the capture method per unit of effort for 
      30 minutes. We captured 211 hosts of which 20 were Rattus rattus and 191 R.
      norvegicus. The specimens were transported to the Instituto Nacional de Salud
      Publica e Investigacion in Guayaquil where the larvae L3 were identified and
      counted in the tissues of the snail, which were then inoculated in laboratory
      rats to reproduce the life cycle. In the rodents, the brains, hearts, lung
      arteries and lungs were dissected, and the parasites were identified by taxonomic
      morphology. Results: Of the snails harvested, 441 were positive for A.
      cantonensis (15.2%) and a total of 6,166 L3 larvae were found; 77 (36.5%)
      specimens of Rattus spp., were infected with A. cantonensis and a total of 220
      parasites (L4-L5 larvae and adult worms) were collected. Conclusions: We
      confirmed the presence of A. cantonensis in several provinces, which ratifies the
      endemic nature of this zoonosis in the national territory. Rattus spp. specimens 
      constitute the definitive hosts of the parasite, which together with the presence
      of intermediate hosts, indicates the zoonotic potential of this parasitic
      infection.

TI  - The cognitive performance of indigenous schoolchildren in relation to their
      feeding during infancy.
PG  - e23326
LID - 10.1002/ajhb.23326 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Nutrition during the first 3 years of life is critical to
      neurodevelopment. Native populations experience poverty, inequality, and food
      insecurity. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between feeding during
      infancy and cognitive performance in schoolchildren of rural indigenous
      communities in Riobamba, Ecuador. METHODS: Thirty-seven schoolchildren (5-6
      years) were recruited. We determined duration of exclusive breastfeeding, weaning
      age, age of cow's milk incorporation, daily intake of cow's milk, age of solid
      and liquid incorporation, and sociocultural and anthropometric parameters.
      Verbal, manipulative, and total intelligence quotients were evaluated with
      Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. RESULTS: Means of verbal,
      manipulative, and total intelligence quotient scores were 86.46 +/- 11.55, 96.39 
      +/- 9.96, and 89.25 +/- 10.43, respectively. Children were exclusively breastfed 
      until 6.83 +/- 3.97 months and weaned at 17.17 +/- 5.58 months. Age of cow's milk
      incorporation was 12.58 +/- 6.06 months, with a daily intake of 737.50 +/- 417.50
      mL. Solids were incorporated at 10.11 +/- 4.43 months and liquids at 7.72 +/-
      3.30 months. Positive associations between duration of exclusive breastfeeding
      and manipulative (unadjusted: rho = .545, P = .006; r = .491, P = .028; adjusted 
      for children's body mass index, and ethnicity and educational level of mothers: r
      = .522, P = .041) and total (unadjusted: rho = .483, P = .017; adjusted: r =
      .572, P = .036) intelligence quotients were found. Frequency of children with
      manipulative (chi(2) [2] = 7.093, P = .029) and total (chi(2) [2] = 7.198, P =
      .027) intelligence quotient >/=90 was higher in those exclusively breastfed >6
      months. Furthermore, schoolchildren in the >6 months group had better
      manipulative (101.75 +/- 9.08 vs 89.71 +/- 8.56, P = .038) and total (94.50 +/-
      11.89 vs 84.86 +/- 5.05, P = .036) intelligence quotient than those in the <6
      months group, independent of anthropometric and sociocultural factors.
      CONCLUSIONS: Longer exclusive breastfeeding was related to better total
      intelligence quotient in rural indigenous schoolchildren.

      Project).

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Evidence of an association between atherosclerosis and sleep
      quality is limited and has not been studied in remote rural settings, where
      living conditions are different than in urban centers. We aimed to assess the
      relationship between the aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and sleep quality in
      older adults living in rural Ecuador. METHODS: Atahualpa residents aged 60 years 
      or older identified during door-to-door surveys, who consented to participate,
      underwent face-to-face interviews with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 
      to assess sleep quality. Aortic PWV determinations were performed for arterial
      stiffness estimation (as a surrogate of atherosclerosis). RESULTS: A total of 303
      individuals were included (mean age: 70.3 +/- 7.8 years; 59% women). Univariate
      logistic regression showed a significant association between the aortic PWV and
      poor sleep quality (odds ratio [OR] 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.39;
      P = .003). A multivariate logistic regression model, adjusted for demographics,
      cardiovascular risk factors, oily fish intake and psychological distress showed a
      significant association between increased PWV and poor sleep quality (OR 1.59;
      95% CI 1.12-2.25; P = .009). Similar significance was noted when the model was
      adjusted for neuroimaging signatures of cerebral small-vessel disease and stroke 
      (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.07-2.03; P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a
      significant independent association between the aortic PWV and poor sleep quality
      in older adults living in rural Ecuador. Results provide more insights into the
      relevance of the impact of sleep disorders on cardiovascular diseases. CLINICAL

      Ecuador.
PG  - 20190141
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2019.0141 [doi]
AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease transmitted by
      species of Phlebotominae sand flies. CL is responsible for more than 1000
      reported cases per year in Ecuador. Vector collection studies in Ecuador suggest 
      that there is a strong association between the ecological diversity of an
      ecosystem, the presence of potential alternative or reservoir hosts and the
      abundance of sand fly species. Data collected from a coastal community in Ecuador
      showed that Leishmania parasites may be circulating in diverse hosts, including
      mammalian and potentially avian species, and these hosts may serve as potential
      hosts for the parasite. There has been limited reporting of CL cases in Ecuador
      because the disease is non-fatal and its surveillance system is passive. Hence,
      the actual incidence of CL is unknown. In this study, an epidemic model was
      developed and analysed to understand the complexity of CL transmission dynamics
      with potential non-human hosts in the coastal ecosystem and to estimate critical 
      epidemiological quantities for Ecuador. The model is fitted to the 2010 CL
      outbreak in the town of Valle Hermoso in the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas
      province of Ecuador and parameters such as CL transmission rates in different
      types of hosts (primary and alternative), and levels of case reporting in the
      town are estimated. The results suggest that the current surveillance in this
      region fails to capture 38% (with 95% CI (29%, 47%)) of the actual number of
      cases under the assumption that alternative hosts are dead-end hosts and that the
      mean CL reproduction number in the town is 3.9. This means that on the average
      3.9 new human CL cases were generated by a single infectious human in the town
      during the initial period of the 2010 outbreak. Moreover, major outbreaks of CL
      in Ecuador in coastal settings are unavoidable until reporting through the
      surveillance system is improved and alternative hosts are managed properly. The
      estimated infection transmission probabilities from alternative hosts to sand
      flies, and sand flies to alternative hosts are 27% and 32%, respectively. The
      analysis highlights that vector control and alternative host management are two
      effective programmes for Ecuador but need to be implemented concurrently to avoid
      future major outbreaks.

      each country. The epidemiology of fractures changes over time, this makes it
      necessary to update the specific FRAX model of each population. It is shown that 
      there are differences between old and new FRAX models in older individuals.
      PURPOSE: A new FRAX(R) model for Ecuador was released online in April 2019. This 
      paper describes the data used to build the revised model, its characteristics,
      and how intervention and assessment thresholds were constructed. METHODS: The
      national rates of hip fracture incidence standardized by age and sex from the age
      of 40 years for 2016 were used to synthesize a FRAX model for Ecuador. For other 
      major fractures, Ecuadorian incidence rates were calculated using ratios obtained
      in Malmo, Sweden, for other major osteoporotic fractures. The new FRAX model was 
      compared with the previous model released in 2012. Assessment and intervention
      thresholds were based on age-specific probabilities of a major osteoporotic
      fracture equivalent to women with a previous fracture. RESULTS: Fracture
      incidence rates increase with age. The probability of hip or major fractures at
      10 years increased in patients with a clinical risk factor, lower BMI, female
      sex, a higher age, and a lower BMD T-score. Compared to the previous model, the
      new FRAX model gave similar 10-year fracture probabilities in men and women age
      less than70 years but substantially higher above this age. Notwithstanding, there
      were very close correlations in fracture probabilities between the two models (> 
      0.99) so that the revision had little impact on the rank order of risk.
      CONCLUSIONS: The FRAX tool provides a country-specific fracture prediction model 
      for Ecuador. This update of the model is based on the original FRAX methodology, 
      which has been validated externally in several independent cohorts. The FRAX
      model is an evolving tool that is being continuously refined, as the databases of
      each country are updated with more epidemiological information.

AB  - Even though there are data published on HPV epidemiology in Ecuador, the
      distribution of genotypes in Guayaquil, the largest city in the country, has not 
      been previously determined in a study including including both, men and women.
      The present study aimed to determine the distribution of 37 HPV genotypes in
      genital samples from Ecuadorian men and women living in the city of Guayaquil.
      Genital samples included in daily diagnostic routine were analyzed by the 37 HPV 
      GenoArray Diagnostic Kit (Hybribio(R) Ltd., Sheung Wan, Hong Kong). The relative 
      frequency of detectable genotypes was determined. HPV relative frequency
      according to sample characteristics, including sex and age groups, was compared
      using c2 test. From the 800 samples (400 men and 400 women), 411 (51.38%) were
      positive for HPV DNA. The obtained frequency was higher among samples from men
      (253/400 or 63.25%) in comparison to samples from women (158/400 or 39.50%), with
      a p value <0.05. Samples from men showed a higher frequency of HPV genotypes 6,
      16, 18 and 11, while among samples from women genotypes 39, 16, 6 and 58 were the
      most frequent. Considering male and female samples together, genotypes 6, 16, 39 
      and 11 presented the highest frequencies. HPV DNA was detected in half of the
      studied samples, with a higher frequency among samples from men. Genotype 39 was 
      the most frequent among women, and ranked third when samples from men and women
      are analyzed together.

TI  - Which Factors may reduce the Health-Related Quality of Life of Ecuadorian
      Patients with Diabetes?
PG  - 102-108
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in Ecuador and to determine its association,
      or lack thereof, with demographic and clinical variables, particularly with the
      comorbidities and complications of DM. METHODS: This was an analytical
      cross-sectional study with 325 patients attending regular care at a primary
      health care center in Quito, Ecuador. HRQoL was measured using the EuroQol
      5-dimension 3-level (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire. The patients were screened for
      diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Clinical 
      files were reviewed to obtain data regarding gender, age, time since diagnosis,
      type of treatment, glycemic control, and history (if any) of hypertension and/or 
      dyslipidemia. Associations were verified using the Mann-Whitney U or
      Kruskal-Wallis test, and the confounding effects of the variables "age" and
      "gender" were controlled for using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The
      mean HRQoL for the population was 0.844 (+/-0.215) on the EQ-5D-3L index
      (EQ-Index) and 80.6 (+/-18.8) on the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The
      prevalence of DM complications was 1.8% for nephropathy, 14.8% for retinopathy,
      and 14.5% for PAD. Of the participating patients, 66.8% presented hypertension
      and 91.4%, dyslipidemia. Significant associations were found between lower scores
      on the EQ-Index and age (>/=65 years) (0.84 vs. 0.87; p = 0.016), time since
      diagnosis (>/=10 years) (0.81 vs. 0.87; p = 0.005), presence of hypertension
      (0.83 vs. 0.88; p = 0.017), and, after controlling for age and gender, presence
      of nephropathy. For the EQ-VAS, only time since diagnosis (>/=10 years) was
      associated with a lower score (77.99 vs. 82.97; p = 0.043). CONCLUSION: Older
      age, longer disease duration, hypertension, and nephropathy are associated with
      having a lower HRQoL, in patients with type 2 DM in Quito, Ecuador.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a survey of international drug donations by the Brazilian
      government from 2005 to 2016, identifying the number of drug units donated and
      the corresponding financial amount. METHOD: This descriptive and exploratory
      study used secondary data available at the Brazilian Health Ministry's Materials 
      Management System (SISMAT). The following information was retrieved: requesting
      country, year of donation, drug donated, number or pharmaceutical unit donated,
      and corresponding amount (in Brazilian reais). RESULTS: During the study period, 
      66 554 892 pharmaceutical units were donated, corresponding to R$ 84 371 308.72
      (US$ 25 505 235.70). Drugs were donated to Angola, Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, 
      Cape Verde, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Cuba, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guiana,
      Republic of Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Honduras, Libya, Mozambique, Nicaragua,
      Paraguay, Peru, Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Syria, and Suriname,
      countries from the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM), and
      Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO). No distribution pattern was detected in 
      quantitative terms. Peaks in the number of drugs donated were recorded in 2008,
      2011, and 2012, with the largest number of countries receiving donations in 2006 
      (n=13) and 2012 (n=14). Drugs were donated for the treatment of HIV/Aids,
      malaria, leishmaniasis, diabetes, cholera, schistosomiasis, tuberculosis,
      influenza, opportunistic diseases, immunizations, nutrition support, and health
      conditions associated with natural disasters. CONCLUSIONS: The drugs donated by
      the Brazilian government included mostly antimicrobial agents used for the
      treatment of neglected tropical diseases. Further studies are suggested to
      correlate public health interventions with the donation of drugs as a means to
      promote the sustainable economic development of the recipient countries.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the clonal relationships
      and phylogroups of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli
      (ESBL-Ec) isolated from patients with bacteraemia in three hospitals in Quito,
      Ecuador. METHODS: Between June 2013 and September 2014, a total of 4354 blood
      cultures were performed in three hospitals located in different areas of Quito. A
      BACTEC(TM) system was used for blood culture, and the VITEK(R)2 system was used
      for species identification and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The
      ESBL genotype, presence of the blaCTX-M, blaTEM and blaSHV genes, and the
      phylogenetic group of E. coli isolates was determined by PCR. Clonal groups were 
      established by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: Of 929 blood cultures 
      positive for Gram-negative bacilli, 181 (19.5%) were positive for E. coli,
      representing the most frequent bacteraemia isolates in each hospital. Of the 181 
      E. coli isolates, 57 (31.5%) were ESBL-Ec. The main sources of ESBL-Ec
      bacteraemia were urinary tract infection (40; 70.2%), biliary tract infection
      (10; 17.5%) and other infections (7; 12.3%). The majority of ESBL-Ec isolates
      (39; 68.4%) from the three hospitals belonged to the virulent phylogenetic group 
      B2, of which 36/39 (92.3%) were ST131 and 33/36 (91.7%) carried the blaCTX-M-15
      gene. CONCLUSION: These results provide knowledge of the phylogenetic
      relationships of E. coli from bacteraemia in Ecuadorian patients. ST131 has
      emerged in ESBL-Ec, representing an important public-health problem because this 
      multiresistant clone is considered to be a vehicle for the propagation of
      antimicrobial resistance genes and is a highly virulent, well-adapted human
      pathogen.

      Ecuador-Americas.

AB  - Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a growing burden worldwide, leading to over 10
      million deaths each year. Previous hypertension surveys in Ecuador, showed that
      there was a prevalence of 28% of adults with hypertension in 1999, 53% in adults 
      between 60 and 75 years in 2010, and. 9.3% in people between 18 and 59 years in
      2012 [Freire WB, Ramirez-Luzuriaga MJ, Belmont P, Mendieta MJ, Silva-Jaramillo
      MK, Romero N, Saenz K, Pineiros P, Gomez LF, Monge R. Tomo I: Encuesta Nacional

      Quito-Ecuador 2014]. The May Measurement Month (MMM) is a global initiative aimed
      at raising awareness of high BP that can temporarily address the lack of
      screening programmes worldwide. Verbal informed consent was obtained from
      respondents. We enrolled 16 sites for the measurement of arterial BP and
      completion of the MMM17 questionnaire, the most important sites being: Guayaquil,
      Quito, Cuenca, Milagro, Esmeraldas, Duran, Naranjito, and Machala. We
      administered the MMM17 survey on 6984 people, of which 50.5% of them were men and
      48.4% were women. Mean age was 46.62 +/- 17.71 SD. The crude mean BP was 115/74
      mmHg. Of the 6984 people who completed the survey, we had 1522 that were already 
      taking anti-hypertensive treatment. The number of people with hypertension
      (>/=140 or >/=90 or on treatment for hypertension) was 1968/6982 (28.2%) persons.
      The number of people with hypertension of those not receiving treatment was
      446/5460 (8.2%) and the number of people receiving treatment but with controlled 
      and uncontrolled BP was 1136/1522 (74.6%) and 386/1522 (25.4%), respectively.
      MMM17 was the largest BP screening campaign undertaken in Ecuador. We identified 
      446 people with hypertension that were not receiving any treatment and 386 people
      with uncontrolled hypertension. These results suggest that opportunistic
      screening can identify significant numbers with raised BP.

TI  - Development and Initial Validation of a Frontline Health Worker mHealth
      Assessment Platform (MEDSINC((R))) for Children 2-60 Months of Age.
PG  - 1556-1565
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.18-0869 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 3 million children younger than 5 years living in low- and
      middle-income countries (LMICs) die each year from treatable clinical conditions 
      such as pneumonia, dehydration secondary to diarrhea, and malaria. A majority of 
      these deaths could be prevented with early clinical assessments and appropriate
      therapeutic intervention. In this study, we describe the development and initial 
      validation testing of a mobile health (mHealth) platform, MEDSINC((R)), designed 
      for frontline health workers (FLWs) to perform clinical risk assessments of
      children aged 2-60 months. MEDSINC is a web browser-based clinical severity
      assessment, triage, treatment, and follow-up recommendation platform developed
      with physician-based Bayesian pattern recognition logic. Initial validation,
      usability, and acceptability testing were performed on 861 children aged between 
      2 and 60 months by 49 FLWs in Burkina Faso, Ecuador, and Bangladesh.
      MEDSINC-based clinical assessments by FLWs were independently and blindly
      correlated with clinical assessments by 22 local health-care professionals
      (LHPs). Results demonstrate that clinical assessments by FLWs using MEDSINC had a
      specificity correlation between 84% and 99% to LHPs, except for two outlier
      assessments (63% and 75%) at one study site, in which local survey prevalence
      data indicated that MEDSINC outperformed LHPs. In addition, MEDSINC triage
      recommendation distributions were highly correlated with those of LHPs, whereas
      usability and feasibility responses from LHP/FLW were collectively positive for
      ease of use, learning, and job performance. These results indicate that the
      MEDSINC platform could significantly increase pediatric health-care capacity in
      LMICs by improving FLWs' ability to accurately assess health status and triage of
      children, facilitating early life-saving therapeutic interventions.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine the best combination between two collection
      method and two extenders in the cryopreservation of semen from creole bulls
      adapted to highlands of the Ecuadorian Andes. Sixty ejaculates from three adult
      Creole bulls were evaluated after collection by artificial vagina (AV) and
      electroejaculation (EE). Semen samples were split into two aliquots and diluted
      with a soy lecithin extender (Andromed(R); A) or an egg yolk-containing extender 
      (Triladyl(R); T) and packed in straws of 0.25 ml with 20 x 10(6) sperms. Optical 
      microscopy and computer-assisted semen analysis system (CASA) were used to
      evaluate semen quality characteristics. The effects of collection methods and
      extender type as well as its interaction were evaluated by a factorial ANOVA and 
      Bonferroni's test. Semen samples collected with EE and frozen with T (EE-T) and A
      (EE-A) had greater proportion of spermatozoa with optical assessed individual
      progressive motility (IPM), plasmatic membrane intact (HosT), and lower tail
      abnormalities than those obtained with AV and frozen with the same extenders
      (AV-T and AV-A); however, differences were significant only between EE-A and
      AV-T. CASA assessment indicated that the total mobility (TM) was greater (P <
      0.05) in semen samples diluted with T, although these samples had a greater
      proportion (P < 0.05) of sperms with local motility (LM) and fewer immobile
      sperms (IS), than those extended with A. Generally, semen samples obtained with
      EE or AV and diluted with T seems to be the best option to ciopreserve gametes of
      Creole bulls raised in highlands of Ecuadorian Andes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Emergence and dissemination of colistin-resistant (Co-R) bacteria
      harboring mobile colistin resistance genes pose a threat for treatment of
      infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. Although the worldwide spread
      of Co-R bacteria is known, the precise state of Co-R bacterial dissemination in
      livestock of Andean countries remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated
      mcr-containing Co-R Escherichia coli dissemination in livestock on small-scale
      farms in two socioecologically different regions of Ecuador: the Amazonian
      rain-forest and the Pacific Coast. RESULTS: Sixty-six rectal swab samples from 34
      pigs and 32 chickens, from five farms in the two regions, were assessed for the
      dissemination of Co-R E. coli using the selective medium CHROMagar COL-APSE.
      mcr-containing Co-R E. coli were detected in the specimens at a high rate (47%;
      31/66), but the detection rates of the two regions were not statistically
      different. Both chickens and pigs showed similar detection rates. All Co-R E.
      coli isolates harbored mcr-1. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of colistin
      were >/= 8 mg/L, and 67.7% (21/31) of the Co-R isolates were multi-drug
      resistant. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the limited relation between
      isolates. Thus, we revealed the high rate of widespread dissemination of Co-R
      bacteria in livestock regardless of the socioecological conditions in Ecuador.

      are sometimes insufficient or do not have an adequate distribution for
      understanding the spatial distribution of pollutants in an urban area. In recent 
      years, some projects have found a connection between remote sensing, air quality 
      and health data. In this study, we apply an empirical land use regression (LUR)
      model to retrieve surface ozone in Quito. The model considers remote sensing
      data, air pollution measurements and meteorological variables. The objective is
      to use all available Landsat 8 images from 2014 and the air quality monitoring
      station data during the same dates of image acquisition. Nineteen input variables
      were considered, selecting by a stepwise regression and modelling with a partial 
      least square (PLS) regression to avoid multicollinearity. The final surface ozone
      model includes ten independent variables and presents a coefficient of
      determination (R(2)) of 0.768. The model proposed help to understand the spatial 
      concentration of surface ozone in Quito with a better spatial resolution.

TI  - Odorants quantitation in high-quality cocoa by multiple headspace solid phase
      micro-extraction: Adoption of FID-predicted response factors to extend method
      capabilities and information potential.

AB  - This paper focuses on several methodological aspects in the quantitation of
      volatiles in solid samples by headspace solid phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME)
      combined with gas chromatography and parallel detection by flame ionization
      detector and mass spectrometry (GC-FID/MS). Informative volatiles, including key 
      odorants and process markers, from single-origin cocoa samples (Colombia,
      Ecuador, Mexico, Sao Tome, and Venezuela) were captured at two processing stages 
      along the chocolate production chain (nibs and cocoa mass). Accurate quantitation
      was achieved by multiple headspace extraction (MHE) in headspace linearity
      conditions and by external calibration. Quantitative results on selected analytes
      (3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-heptanol, 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine,
      2-ethyl-3,6-dimethylpyrazine, ethyl octanoate, benzaldehyde, 2-methylpropionic
      acid, 3-methylbutyric acid, ethyl phenylacetate, 2-phenylethyl acetate, guaiacol,
      2-phenylethanol, and (E)-2-phenyl-2-butenal) provided reliable information about 
      the key sensory notes of cocoa intermediates (odor activity values) and their
      origin specificities. Additional information about analytes release by the solid 
      environment (cocoa nibs, mass, and powders) was achieved by modeling decay
      curves. Parallel detection by MS and FID enabled quantitative cross-validation,
      and FID-predicted relative response factors (RRFs) extended method quantitation
      capabilities to additional compounds that were not subjected to an external
      calibration procedure: 3-methylbutyl acetate (isoamyl acetate), 2-heptanone,
      heptanal, 2-nonanone, gamma-butyrolactone, octanoic acid,
      2-ethyl-5(6)-methylpyrazine, phenylacetic acid, phenol, 2-acetyl pyrrole, and
      2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl(4H)-pyran-4-one. This procedure extends method
      capabilities and information potential with great consistency.

AB  - Forty-one species in five genera of bitentaculate cirratulids are reported from
      new collections from South America, the Southern Ocean, and seas around
      Antarctica. Twenty-seven species are new to science; one new genus is described
      to deal with some species formerly identified as Chaetozone. New records,
      synonymies, and new combinations are reported. Previous records are reviewed with
      type specimens of most species reexamined and redescribed. The sub-Antarctic
      species Aphelochaeta cincinnata (Ehlers, 1908) does not occur in Antarctica: the 
      numerous published records of this species instead belong to several new species.
      The types of Tharyx epitocus Monro, 1930, and Tharyx fusiformis Monro, 1939, have
      spines in posterior setigers and are referred to other genera. Among the 41
      species treated in this study, 11 belong to Aphelochaeta, eight are new; eight
      species belong to Caulleriella, six are new; six species belong to
      Chaetocirratulus n. gen., three are new; 12 species belong to Chaetozone, seven
      are new; and four species belong to Tharyx, three are new. Numerous samples come 
      from slope and abyssal depths, expanding our knowledge of the distribution of
      Southern hemisphere deep-sea cirratulids.

TI  - Flavonoids in Ecuadorian Oreocallis grandiflora (Lam.) R. Br.: Perspectives of
      Use of This Species as a Food Supplement.
PG  - 1353129
LID - 10.1155/2018/1353129 [doi]
AB  - Oreocallis grandiflora (Lam.) R. Br. is an Ecuadorian species belonging to the
      Proteaceae family, commonly known as cucharillo (Loja and Zamora provinces),
      cucharilla (Sierra region), ganal (Bolivar province), and algil (Chimborazo
      province). Its leaves and flowers, collected during blooming, are traditionally
      used for oral administration to treat liver diseases, vaginal bleeding, and
      ovary/uterus inflammation and as digestive, diuretic, and hypoglycemic remedy.
      Related literature does not report any scientific evidences regarding the
      chemical composition of the used parts of this species (leaves and flowers),
      while few indications are reported about the healthy properties of their
      preparations. Based on these premises, the present research was performed with
      the objectives to fill the gaps of the chemical and biological knowledge about
      this species, enriching the knowledge related to the plant biodiversity of
      Amazonian Ecuador and to the ethnobotanical tradition of Andean communities.
      Chemical and biological investigation (in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
      activity) of flower and leaf hydroalcoholic extracts shed a light on the
      functional metabolites putatively involved in healthy properties of the O.
      grandiflora traditional preparations. The chemical fingerprinting achieved by
      HPTLC and (1)HNMR analyses showed the presence of flavonoids, subsequently
      quantitatively estimated by AlCl3 complexation assay and HPLC-DAD. Silica gel
      chromatography allowed the isolation of the main compounds of the flower extract:
      quercetin 3-O-beta-glucuronide and myricetin 3-O-beta-glucuronide. RP-HPLC-DAD-MS
      analyses showed the presence of quercetin 3-O-rutinoside and isorhamnetin
      3-O-rutinoside, in addition to the above-mentioned molecules, in the leaf
      extract. Regarding the antioxidant (DPPH test, a radical scavenging assay) and
      anti-inflammatory (WST-1 assay, an oxidative burst test) activities, leaf extract
      showed the most promising results when compared to the positive controls. The
      same extract, however, exhibited a higher cytotoxicity compared to the flower
      extract, indicating the latter preparation as the most interesting
      anti-inflammatory crude drug.

TI  - Knowledge Extraction and Improved Data Fusion for Sales Prediction in Local
      Agricultural Markets.
LID - E286 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s19020286 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, a monitoring system of agricultural production is modeled as a
      Data Fusion System (data from local fairs and meteorological data). The proposal 
      considers the particular information of sales in agricultural markets for
      knowledge extraction about the associations among them. This association
      knowledge is employed to improve predictions of sales using a spatial prediction 
      technique, as shown with data collected from local markets of the Andean region
      of Ecuador. The commercial activity in these markets uses Alternative Marketing
      Circuits (CIALCO). This market platform establishes a direct relationship between
      producer and consumer prices and promotes direct commercial interaction among
      family groups. The problem is presented first as a general fusion problem with a 
      network of spatially distributed heterogeneous data sources, and is then applied 
      to the prediction of products sales based on association rules mined in available
      sales data. First, transactional data is used as the base to extract the best
      association rules between products sold in different local markets, knowledge
      that allows the system to gain a significant improvement in prediction accuracy
      in the spatial region considered.

TI  - Risk Factors Associated with Attacks of Hematophagous Bats (Desmodus rotundus) on
      Cattle in Ecuador.
PG  - 407-413
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2017.2247 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, there has been an increasing risk of hematophagous bat attacks
      in Latin America, where livestock production is a basic source of food for local 
      populations. In Ecuador, livestock represented an important part of agricultural 
      output. Some cases of cattle bitten by bats in the province of Santa Elena have
      been reported; however, no previous studies have been conducted to determine the 
      magnitude of the attacks and the associated risk factors. In this research, a
      cross-sectional descriptive study was performed recording attacks of
      hematophagous bats (Desmodus rotundus) through visual inspection of livestock and
      the capture of specimens by mist nets. Generally, the prevalence of D. rotundus
      attacks on farms was 69%, whereas attacks on bovine had 24% of prevalence. From
      the captured specimens, 93% were identified as D. rotundus and within the 30% of 
      the captured D. rotundus, no infections for rabies virus were diagnosed. The
      univariable analysis used for estimating the risk factors associated with bat
      attacks showed that corrals away from populated centers present the highest risk 
      (odds ratio [OR] = 19.864; p = 0.0004), followed by tree density >30 per hectare 
      (OR = 16.313; p < 0.0001) and predatory birds of bats (OR = 15.375; p < 0.0001); 
      a binary logistic regression model showed "corrals away from populated centers"
      (OR = 23.47; p = 0.006) as the main risk factor. Linear regression analysis
      showed good correlation between the number of bovines attacked and the number of 
      bites (R(2) = 0.977; p < 0.0001) suggesting some feeding patterns of D. rotundus.
      This study could be used as a starting point for understanding the feeding habits
      of D. rotundus and factors governing their attacks in coastal regions of Ecuador,
      and potential occurrences of rabies infections. With this knowledge, surveillance
      and control programs can be supported to improve rabies transmission monitoring.

TI  - Detection of Zika Virus and Human Papilloma Virus in Cervical Cytology Samples
      using Two Real Time PCR Based Techniques in Ecuadorian Women diagnosed with
      ASCUS.
PG  - S96-S98
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance(ASCUS) is the
      most reported result on pap smears. It is most commonly related to Human
      Papillomavirus (HPV) infections. However, other pathogens (EBV, Chlamydia) have
      been reported on cervical samples with abnormal results. Zika virus(ZIKV) has
      been found to induce cellular abnormalities on different tissues and its presence
      has been identified on genital secretions. METHODS: Two real-time PCR has been
      made on cervical samples from the gynecological service of a third level hospital
      on Guayaquil-Ecuador. This work was part of a bigger study of ZIKV presence on
      different body fluids. RESULTS: From 89 samples obtained, 19 received an ASCUS
      result. From these 5 were positive for ZIKV and 5 were positive for HPV, there
      were no co infections. CONCLUSION: Given the presence of ZIKV RNA and the absence
      of HPV DNA on cervical samples diagnosed as ASCUS, it might be plausible that
      ZIKV could be a triggering factor for the induction of cellular changes observed 
      on these cells.

TI  - Rifamycin SV-MMX(R) for treatment of travellers' diarrhea: equally effective as
      ciprofloxacin and not associated with the acquisition of multi-drug resistant
      bacteria.
LID - 10.1093/jtm/tay116 [doi]
AB  - Background: The novel oral antibiotic formulation Rifamycin SV-MMX(R), with a
      targeted delivery to the distal small bowel and colon, was superior to placebo in
      treating travellers' diarrhea (TD) in a previous study. Thus, a study was
      designed to compare this poorly absorbed antibiotic with the systemic agent
      ciprofloxacin. Methods: In a randomized double-blind phase 3 study (ERASE), the
      efficacy and safety of Rifamycin SV-MMX(R) 400 mg twice daily (RIF-MMX) was
      compared with ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily in the oral treatment of TD.
      Overall, 835 international visitors to India, Guatemala or Ecuador with acute TD 
      were randomized to receive a 3-day treatment with RIF-MMX (n = 420) or
      ciprofloxacin (n = 415). Primary endpoint was time to last unformed stool (TLUS),
      after which clinical cure was declared. Stools samples for microbiological
      evaluation were collected at the baseline visit and the end of treatment visit.
      Results: Median TLUS in the RIF-MMX group was 42.8 h versus 36.8 h in the
      ciprofloxacin group indicating non-inferiority of RIF-MMX to ciprofloxacin (P =
      0.0035). Secondary efficacy endpoint results including clinical cure rate,
      treatment failure rate, requirement of rescue therapy as well as microbiological 
      eradication rate confirmed those of the primary analysis indicating equal
      efficacy for both compounds. While patients receiving ciprofloxacin showed a
      significant increase of Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase Producing-Escherichia
      coli (ESBL-E. Coli) colonization rates after 3-days treatment (6.9%), rates did
      not increase in patients receiving RIF-MMX (-0.3%). Both drugs were
      well-tolerated and safe. Conclusion: The novel multi-matrix formulation of the
      broad-spectrum, poorly absorbed antibiotic Rifamycin SV was found non-inferior to
      the systemic antibiotic ciprofloxacin in the oral treatment of non-dysenteric TD 
      with the advantage of a lower risk of ESBL-E. Coli acquisition.

TI  - Ring chromosome 15 - cytogenetics and mapping arrays: a case report and review of
      the literature.
PG  - 340
LID - 10.1186/s13256-018-1879-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ring chromosome 15 has been associated in previous studies with
      different clinical characteristic such as cardiac problems, digit and
      musculoskeletal abnormalities, and mental and motor problems among others. Only
      97 clinical cases of ring chromosome 15 syndrome have been reported since 1966
      and a common phenotype for these patients has not been established. CASE
      PRESENTATION: The present case report describes a 15-month-old girl from the
      Amazon region of Ecuador, of Mestizo ancestry, who after cytogenetic tests showed
      a 46,XX,r(15) karyotype in more than 70% of metaphases observed. Her parents were
      healthy and non-related. The pregnancy was complicated and was positive for
      intrauterine growth retardation. Her birth weight was 1950 g, her length was 43.5
      cm, and she had a head circumference of 29.3. In addition to postnatal growth
      delay, she had scant frontal hair, small eyes, hypertelorism, low-set of ears,
      flattened nasal bridge, anteverted nostrils, down-turned mouth, three cafe au
      lait spots, and delayed dentition. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the frequency of some
      phenotypes expressed in the different clinical cases reviewed and the present
      case, a common phenotype for patients with ring 15 could not be determined and it
      is restricted to the region of the chromosome lost during the ring formation.

TI  - Influence of ecological factors on the presence of a triatomine species
      associated with the arboreal habitat of a host of Trypanosoma cruzi.
PG  - 567
LID - 10.1186/s13071-018-3138-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The white-naped squirrel, Simosciurus nebouxii (previously known as
      Sciurus stramineus), has recently been identified as an important natural host
      for Trypanosoma cruzi in Ecuador. The nests of this species have been reported as
      having high infestation rates with the triatomine vector Rhodnius ecuadoriensis. 
      The present study aims to determine the levels of nest infestation with R.
      ecuadoriensis, the ecological variables that are influencing the nest site
      selection, and the relationship between R. ecuadoriensis infestation and
      trypanosome infection. RESULTS: The study was carried out in transects in forest 
      patches near two rural communities in southern Ecuador. We recorded ecological
      information of the trees that harbored squirrel nests and the trees within a 10 m
      radius. Manual examinations of each nest determined infestation with triatomines.
      We recorded 498 trees (n = 52 with nests and n = 446 without nests). Rhodnius
      ecuadoriensis was present in 59.5% of the nests and 60% presented infestation
      with nymphs (colonization). Moreover, we detected T. cruzi in 46% of the
      triatomines analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that tree height influences nest
      site selection, which is consistent with previous observations of squirrel
      species. Factors such as the diameter at breast height and the interaction
      between tree height and tree species were not sufficient to explain squirrel nest
      presence or absence. However, the nest occupancy and tree richness around the
      nest were significant predictors of the abundance of triatomines. Nevertheless,
      the variables of colonization and infection were not significant, and the data
      observed could be expected because of chance alone (under the null hypothesis).
      This study ratifies the hypothesis that the ecological features of the forest
      patches around rural communities in southern Ecuador favor the presence of
      nesting areas for S. nebouxii and an increase of the chances of having
      triatomines that maintain T. cruzi populations circulating in areas near human
      dwellings. Additionally, these results highlight the importance of including
      ecological studies to understand the dynamics of T. cruzi transmission due to the
      existence of similar ecological and land use features along the distribution of
      the dry forest of southern Ecuador and northern Peru, which implies similar
      challenges for Chagas disease control.

TI  - Regulatory initiatives to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in Latin
      America.
PG  - e0205694
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0205694 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Latin American (LA) countries have begun to adopt a
      variety of regulations targeting sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) for public
      health reasons. Our objective was to characterize the regulatory strategies
      designed to reduce SSB consumption over the last decade, and assess the available
      evidence on their enforcement and impact. METHODS: We searched legal and public
      health databases for public and private SSBs regulations in 14 LA countries and
      then conducted a systematic review of the available literature. We tracked
      comparative variations in the type of body issuing the regulations, their scope, 
      and binding status. We present data following a 5-category framework we named
      NUTRE that classifies SSBs regulations as: (1) restrictions to SSB availability
      in schools (N), (2) taxes and other economic incentives to discourage consumption
      (U), (3) restrictions on advertising and marketing (T), (4) regulations on
      government procurement and subsidies (R), and (5) product labeling rules (E).
      RESULTS: Since 2006, 14 LA countries have adopted at least 39 public and private 
      SSB regulatory initiatives across the NUTRE framework. Comprehensive efforts have
      only been approved by Chile, Mexico and Ecuador, while the rest have
      comparatively few initiatives. 28 out of the 39 regulatory initiatives were
      passed by legislative and executive bodies; 11 initiatives represent
      self-regulatory undertakings by the beverage industries. An 86% (24/28) of public
      sector regulations are binding; 56% (22/39) contain explicit monitoring or
      evaluation methods; and 62% (24/39) provide for sanctions. Moreover, 23
      regulations specify the body in charge of monitoring the new rules and standards.
      CONCLUSIONS: LA countries are targeting SSB consumption through a variety of
      mechanisms, particularly via restrictions to availability in schools and through 
      taxes. Interdisciplinary evidence comparing alternative regulatory strategies is 
      scarce, and few studies offer data on impact and implementation challenges. More 
      evidence and further comparative assessments are needed to support future
      decision-making.

AB  - The relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) and oropharyngeal squamous
      cell carcinoma has been established. However, data from Ecuador is limited. The
      objective of this study was to characterize HPV infection in Ecuadorian patients 
      with tongue cancer. Fifty-three patients with tongue cancer treated at the
      tertiary referral center Sociedad de Lucha Contra el Cancer (SOLCA), Guayaquil,
      between 2006 and 2011 were identified. Linear Array(R) HPV genotyping was used to
      identify the presence and types of HPV on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy
      samples from these patients with tongue cancer. HPV was identified in 42% (n=22) 
      and high-risk (HR) HPV in 17% (n=9), with 18 different HPV types identified. The 
      most common types were the HR HPV 33 (14%) and low-risk HPV 67 (14%), followed by
      the HR HPV 58. More than one HPV type was identified in 27.3% of cases. HPV 33
      was frequently associated with other HPV types. No statistically significant
      differences in gender (P=0.58) and age (P=0.12) were observed between
      HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases. HPV was identified in almost half of the
      tongue cancer samples, with subtypes 33 and 67 being the most common. This
      suggested that HPV played an important role in this disease in the population
      studied. Given these results, current HPV vaccines may not be as effective in
      reducing tongue cancer rates in this population.

AB  - Background: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) continue to be an important cause 
      of disability and mortality in the poorest tropical and subtropical areas.
      Methods: This is an ecological study. We included all death certificates with
      dengue, cysticercosis and Chagas disease in Ecuador from 2011 to 2016. The
      spatial autocorrelation was evaluated by GeoDa software through the Global
      Moran's I index and the formation of clusters by the local index of spatial
      association. Results: The Global Moran's I index for the study period shows a
      positive spatial autocorrelation for dengue, cysticercosis and Chagas disease
      (0.25, p=0.001; 0.07, p=0.04; 0.45, p=0.001, respectively). Conclusions: The
      clusters identified as higher risk in the country could be targeted by
      policymakers to adequately develop strategies to strengthen health promotion
      policies that break the cycle of these diseases.

AB  - Recent cadmium (Cd) regulation in chocolate threatens the sustainability of cacao
      production in Southwest America. Cadmium contamination in cacao beans has not
      been assessed at a country level. A nationwide survey was conducted in Ecuador to
      identify the spatial distribution of Cd in cacao beans, as well as soil and
      agronomic factors involved. Paired soil and plant samples (pods and leaves) were 
      collected at 560 locations. Information on agronomic practices was obtained
      through a prepared questionnaire for farmers. Total soil Cd averaged 0.44mgkg(-1)
      which is typical for young and non-polluted soils. Mean Cd concentration in
      peeled beans was 0.90mgkg(-1) and 45% of samples exceeded the 0.60mgkg(-1)
      threshold. Bean Cd hotspots were identified in some areas in seven provinces.
      Multivariate regression analysis showed that bean Cd concentrations increased
      with increasing total soil Cd and with decreasing soil pH, oxalate-extractable
      manganese (Mnox) and organic carbon (OC) (R(2)=0.65), suggesting that Cd
      solubility in soil mainly affects Cd uptake. Bean Cd concentration decreased a
      factor of 1.4 as the age of the orchard increased from 4 to 40years. Bean Cd
      concentration was inconsistently affected by genotype (CCN-51 vs. Nacional),
      pruning or application of fertilizers. It is concluded that the relatively larger
      bean Cd concentrations in Ecuador are related to the high Cd uptake capacity of
      the plants combined with their cultivation on young soils, instead of Cd depleted
      weathered soils. Mitigation strategies should consider the application of
      amendments to modify such soil properties to lower soil Cd availability. There is
      scope for genetic mitigation strategy to reduce bean Cd, but this needs to be
      properly investigated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To introduce 3 novel intensive facial plastic and reconstructive
      surgery teaching modules for surgical capacity building using simulation in a
      low-middle income country. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING:
      University-based medical center in Quito, Ecuador. PARTICIPANTS: First- and
      second-year otolaryngology residents in Quito, Ecuador. RESULTS: Residents
      participated in an intensive 3-day teaching program focused on microtia,
      nasoseptal abnormalities, and facial paralysis that included didactic lectures,
      simulation workshops, and live surgery. Residents underwent rigorous pre- and
      postmodule testing including written, oral, and practical examinations in each
      subject area. All participants completed anonymous feedback surveys with ratings 
      on a Likert scale from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent). Nineteen residents
      completed both pre- and postmodule testing. The training module was successfully 
      implemented and testing performance across all 3 subject areas significantly
      improved. Resident feedback was exceedingly positive, with average scores for
      each component ranging from 8.9 to 9.8, with highest scores given to the
      simulation workshops. The postmodule survey indicated that all residents found
      the course helpful and they desired additional courses covering more subject
      areas. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an intensive surgical training module
      combining didactics, surgical simulation, and live surgery resulted in the
      successful transfer of both skills and knowledge. While the long-term benefit of 
      this program is yet to be determined, this model of training may prove to be a
      useful tool to help address surgical capacity building in the developing world.

AB  - Background: Insufficient physical activity (PA) and excessive sedentary behavior 
      (SB) are the main contributors to adolescent obesity. However, it is uncertain
      whether recent economic growth and urbanization in Ecuador are contributing to an
      obesogenic environment. This study assessed the relationships among fitness, PA, 
      SB, and perceived social support for PA in adolescents from urban (Quito) and
      rural (Loja) Ecuador. Methods: Fitness was estimated using 3-min step test and PA
      and SB participation and social support for PA were self-reported in 407
      adolescents. T-tests and analysis of variance assessed differences by sex,
      obesity status, and region of Ecuador. Pearson correlations assessed
      relationships among PA, SB, fitness, and social support. Results: Males and rural
      adolescents (48.3 +/- 9.4 and 47.1 +/- 9.6 mL/kg/min) were more fit than females 
      and urban adolescents (41.1 +/- 7.5 and 39.7 +/- 6.1 mL/kg/min). Fitness was
      negatively correlated with obesity only in rural Ecuador. Few adolescents
      reported >/=60 min/day of PA (8.4%) or </=2 h/day of SB (30.2%), with greater SB 
      participation in rural Ecuador. Weak correlations were observed among fitness,
      PA, SB, and parental/peer support for PA (r = -0.18 to 0.19; p < 0.05).
      Conclusion: While fitness varied by sex, weight status, and region, SB
      participation and parent/peer support for PA, not PA participation itself,
      predicted fitness in rural Ecuadorean adolescents.

AB  - Becoming valuable to fellow group members so that one would attract assistance in
      times of need is a major adaptive problem. To solve it, the individual needs a
      predictive map of the degree to which others value different acts so that, in
      choosing how to act, the payoff arising from others' valuation of a potential
      action (e.g., showing bandmates that one is a skilled forager by pursuing a
      hard-to-acquire prey item) can be added to the direct payoff of the action (e.g.,
      gaining the nutrients of the prey captured). The pride system seems to
      incorporate all of the elements necessary to solve this adaptive problem.
      Importantly, data from western(-ized), educated, industrialized, rich, and
      democratic (WEIRD) societies indicate close quantitative correspondences between 
      pride and the valuations of audiences. Do those results generalize beyond
      industrial mass societies? To find out, we conducted an experiment among 567
      participants in 10 small-scale societies scattered across Central and South
      America, Africa, and Asia: (i) Bosawas Reserve, Nicaragua; (ii) Cotopaxi,
      Ecuador; (iii) Draa-Tafilalet, Morocco; (iv) Enugu, Nigeria; (v) Le Morne,
      Mauritius; (vi) La Gaulette, Mauritius; (vii) Tuva, Russia; (viii) Shaanxi and
      Henan, China; (ix) farming communities in Japan; and (x) fishing communities in
      Japan. Despite widely varying languages, cultures, and subsistence modes, pride
      in each community closely tracked the valuation of audiences locally (mean r =
      +0.66) and even across communities (mean r = +0.29). This suggests that the pride
      system not only develops the same functional architecture everywhere but also
      operates with a substantial degree of universality in its content.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Burden of disease studies intend to improve public health
      decision-making and to measure social and economic impact in population. The
      objective of this study was to describe the burden of acute respiratory
      infections (ARI) in Ecuador between 2011 and 2015. METHODS: Five-year period
      morbidity and mortality data available from national agencies of statistics was
      analyzed to estimate the burden of disease attributable to acute respiratory
      infections. Cases and deaths registered were grouped according to their ICD-10
      code into three diagnostic groups: Acute upper respiratory infections (J00-J06), 
      Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), and Bronchitis and other acute lower
      respiratory infections (J20-J22, J85, J86). Disability-adjusted life years
      stratified by diagnostic and age group were calculated using the "DALY" package
      for R. The productivity loss in monetary terms was estimated using the human
      capital method. RESULTS: Over the 5-year period studied there were a total of
      14.84 million cases of acute respiratory infections, with 17 757 deaths reported 
      (0.12%). The yearly burden of disease ranged between 98 944 to 118 651
      disability-adjusted life years, with an estimated average loss of productivity of
      US$152.16 million (+/-19.6) per year. Approximately 99% of the burden can be
      attributed to years life lost due to premature mortality in population under 5
      years old and over 60 years-old. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of acute respiratory
      infections remained steady during the analyzed period. Evidence-based prevention 
      and control policies to tackle acute respiratory infections in Ecuador should
      focus on the population at extreme ages of life.

      Ecuadorian Andean River.

AB  - Epilithic diatom communities are particularly suitable for the evaluation of
      freshwater quality. In Ecuador, however, no water quality index includes this
      biotic parameter. This work is the first attempt in the country to determine the 
      composition of epilithic diatom communities associated with different degrees of 
      eutrophication. This was accomplished by measuring physical, chemical and
      microbiological variables at five sampling sites along the Pita River, Ecuador,
      from August to December 2016. The results indicate a clear gradient of
      eutrophication from sampling sites P1 (good water) in the upper reaches to P5
      (bad water) located in the lower reaches. Concerning diatom analyses, the results
      indicated a high diversity for tropical areas in terms of species richness,
      varying from S=34 in headwaters to S=42 downstream. Moreover, the results
      obtained suggest a lack of concordance with the trophic values given to some of
      the epilithic diatoms in the literature. There were also species that seem to be 
      sensitive to downstream nutrient increases that were not considered as
      bioindicators in previous studies. We concluded that the trophic values of diatom
      species available in the scientific literature are not directly applicable to
      their sites in the Pita River. Hence, it is necessary to establish a trophic
      diatom index for the Andean region of Ecuador.

TI  - Elimination of onchocerciasis from Colombia: first proof of concept of river
      blindness elimination in the world.
PG  - 237
LID - 10.1186/s13071-018-2821-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Onchocerciasis is a chronic parasitic infection originally endemic in
      13 discrete regional foci distributed among six countries of Latin America
      (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Venezuela). In Colombia, this
      disease was discovered in 1965 in the Pacific Coast of the country. The National 
      Onchocerciasis Elimination Program was established in 1993 with the aim of
      eliminating disease morbidity and infection transmission. In 2013, the World
      Health Organization (WHO) verified Colombia as free of onchocerciasis, becoming
      the first country in the world to reach such a goal. This report provides the
      empirical evidence of the elimination of Onchocerca volvulus transmission by
      Simulium exiguum (s.l.) after 12 years of 6-monthly mass drug administration of
      Mectizan(R) (ivermectin) to all the eligible residents living in this endemic
      area. METHODS: From 1996 onwards, a biannual community-based mass ivermectin
      administration programme was implemented, complemented by health education and
      community participation. In-depth parasitological, serological and entomological 
      surveys were conducted periodically between 1998 and 2007 to evaluate the impact 
      of ivermectin treatment according to the 2001 WHO guidelines. When the
      interruption of parasite transmission was demonstrated, the drug distribution
      ceased and a three-year post-treatment surveillance (PTS) period (2008-2010) was 
      initiated. RESULTS: After 23 rounds of treatment, parasitological and
      ophthalmological assessments showed absence of microfilariae in skin and anterior
      chamber of the eyes. Serological tests proved lack of antibodies against O.
      volvulus in children under 10 years-old. A total of 10,500 S. exiguum flies
      tested by PCR had no L3 infection (infectivity rate = 0.0095%; 95% CI:
      0.0029-0.049) during 2004, indicating interruption of parasite transmission.
      However, biannual ivermectin treatments continued until 2007 followed by a 3-year
      PTS period at the end of which 13,481 flies were analyzed and no infective flies 
      were found (infectivity rate = 0%; 95% CI: 0.0-0.014). CONCLUSIONS: These results
      fulfilled the WHO criteria for onchocerciasis elimination. Consequently, in 2013 
      Colombia was verified as free of onchocerciasis, demonstrating that elimination
      of this neglected tropical disease is an achievable goal and paving the way for
      an elimination agenda to be followed by other endemic countries in Latin America 
      and Africa.

TI  - High altitude arterialised capillary earlobe blood gas measurement using the
      Abbott i-STAT.
PG  - 335-337

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Measurement of physiological parameters in extreme environments is 
      essential to advancing knowledge, prophylaxis and treatment of altitude sickness.
      Point-of-care testing facilitates investigation in non-specialist and remote
      settings, as well as becoming increasingly popular at the bedside for real-time
      results in the clinical environment. Arterialised capillary earlobe blood gases
      are recommended as a valid alternative to arterial sampling in research. This
      study aimed to test the feasibility of obtaining and analysing daily earlobe
      samples at high altitude. METHODS: From 17 to 24 January 2016, 24 participants on
      a research expedition to Ecuador underwent daily earlobe blood gas measurements
      including pH, partial pressure of oxygen and partial pressure of carbon dioxide
      to 5043 m. Samples were analysed using an Abbott i-STAT blood gas analyser and
      G3+ cartridges. RESULTS: Daily measurements were successfully obtained and
      analysed at the point of care in 23/24 participants and were well tolerated with 
      no adverse events. 12% (27/220) cartridges failed and required repeat sampling.
      CONCLUSIONS: Daily earlobe blood gas analysis using the Abbott i-STAT is feasible
      in a protected environment at high altitude. Participants and equipment should be
      kept warm before and during testing. Spare cartridges should be available. This
      methodology may be useful for both research and therapeutic measurements in
      remote, rural and wilderness medicine.

TI  - Identification of a New Mullet Species Complex Based on an Integrative Molecular 
      and Cytogenetic Investigation of Mugil hospes (Mugilidae: Mugiliformes).
PG  - 17
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2018.00017 [doi]
AB  - Mullets are very common fishes included in the family Mugilidae, (Mugiliformes), 
      which are characterized by both a remarkably uniform external morphology and
      internal anatomy. Recently, within this family, different species complexes were 
      molecularly identified within Mugil, a genus which is characterized by lineages
      that sometimes show very different karyotypes. Here we report the results of
      cytogenetic and molecular analyses conducted on Mugil hospes, commonly known as
      the hospe mullet, from Ecuador. The study aims to verify whether the original
      described species from the Pacific Ocean corresponds to that identified in the
      Atlantic Ocean, and to identify species-specific chromosome markers that can add 
      new comparative data about Mugilidae karyotype evolution. The karyotype of M.
      hospes from Ecuador is composed of 48 acrocentric chromosomes and shows two
      active nucleolar organizer regions (NORs). In situ hybridization, using different
      types of repetitive sequences (rDNAs, U1 snDNA, telomeric repeats) as probes,
      identified species-specific chromosome markers that have been compared with those
      of other species of the genus Mugil. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)
      sequence analysis shows only 92-93% similarity with sequences previously
      deposited under this species name in GenBank, all of which were from the Atlantic
      Ocean. Phylogenetic reconstructions indicate the presence of three well-supported
      hospe mullet lineages whose molecular divergence is compatible with the presence 
      of distinct species. Indeed, the first lineage includes samples from Ecuador,
      whereas the other two lineages include the Atlantic samples and correspond to M. 
      brevirostris from Brazil and Mugil sp. R from Belize/Venezuela. Results here
      provided reiterate the pivotal importance of an integrative molecular and
      cytogenetic approach in the reconstruction of the relationships within Mugilidae.

TI  - Identifying the social and environmental determinants of plague endemicity in
      Peru: insights from a case study in Ascope, La Libertad.
PG  - 220
LID - 10.1186/s12889-018-5062-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plague remains a public health problem in specific areas located in
      Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru. Its prevention and control encompasses
      adequate clinical management and timely laboratory diagnosis. However,
      understanding communities' interaction with its surrounding ecosystem as well as 
      the differences between community members and institutional stakeholders
      regarding the root causes of plague might contribute to understand its
      endemicity. We aim at bridging the traditionally separate biological and social
      sciences by elucidating communities' risk perception and identifying knowledge
      gaps between communities and stakeholders. This approach has been used in other
      areas but never in understanding plague endemicity, nor applied in the Latin
      American plague context. The objectives were to identify (i) plague risk
      perception at community level, (ii) perceived social and environmental
      determinants of plague endemicity, and (iii) institutions that need to be
      involved and actions needed to be taken as proposed by stakeholders and community
      members. The study was performed in 2015 and took place in Ascope rural province,
      La Libertad Region, in Peru, where the study areas are surrounded by intensive
      private sugarcane production. METHODS: We propose using a multi-level discourse
      analysis. Community households were randomly selected (n = 68). Structured and
      semi-structured questionnaires were applied. A stakeholder analysis was used to
      identify policy makers (n = 34). In-depth interviews were performed, recorded and
      transcribed. Descriptive variables were analyzed with SPSS(R). Answers were coded
      following variables adapted from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health 
      and analyzed with the assistance of ATLAS.ti(R). RESULTS: Results showed that
      risk perception was low within the community. Policy-makers identified
      agriculture and sugarcane production as the root cause while community answers
      ranked the hygiene situation as the main cause. Stakeholders first ranked
      governmental sectors (education, housing, agriculture and transport) and the
      community prioritized the health sector. Social surveillance and improving
      prevention and control were first cited by policy-makers and community members,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The determinants of plague endemicity identified by
      the two groups differed. Similarly, actions and sectors needed to be involved in 
      solving the problem varied. The gaps in understanding plague root causes between 
      these two groups might hinder the efficiency of current plague prevention and
      control strategies.

TI  - Clinical characterization and antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli in
      pediatric patients with urinary tract infection at a third level hospital of
      Quito, Ecuador.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most common infections
      in pediatric patients. The main etiopathogenic agent is Escherichia coli. The
      purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance pattern of E.
      coli in pediatric patients and to understand their main clinical and laboratory
      manifestations. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients were included in the study and
      classified into two groups: hospitalization (H) and external consultation (EC).
      Every patient presented urine cultures with the isolation of E. coli that
      included an antibiogram. Clinical signs and symptoms, urinalysis, complete blood 
      count (CBC) and serum inflammatory markers were analyzed. RESULTS: The most
      common clinical manifestations were fever (H: 76.5%; EC: 88%), vomiting (H:
      32.4%; EC: 32%), hyporexia (H: 20.6%; EC: 16%), abdominal pain (H: 20.6%: EC:
      28%), and dysuria (H: 14.7%; EC: 32%). Ten patients (16.95%) presented UTI for
      extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli. Ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and 
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole showed a higher resistance rate, being ampicillin
      the most significant (H: 88.2%; EC: 92%). Leukocyturia, bacteriuria and urine
      nitrites were frequent alterations in urinalysis (H: 52.9%; EC: 92%). In ESBL E. 
      coli patients, a positive correlation was found between leukocytes in CBC and
      C-reactive protein (r = 0.9, p < 0.01). Diarrhea and foul-smelling urine were
      associated with E. coli resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of leukocytes,
      bacteria, nitrites and the Gram stain are the most common indicators.
      Nitrofurantoin and phosphomycin are good therapeutic options. However, an
      antibiogram must be conducted to determine the best therapeutic agent.

AB  - Maize chlorotic mottle virus has been rapidly spreading around the globe over the
      past decade. The interactions of maize chlorotic mottle virus with Potyviridae
      viruses causes an aggressive synergistic viral condition - maize lethal necrosis,
      which can cause total yield loss. Maize production in sub-Saharan Africa, where
      it is the most important cereal, is threatened by the arrival of maize lethal
      necrosis. We obtained maize chlorotic mottle virus genome sequences from across
      East Africa and for the first time from Ecuador and Hawaii, and constructed a
      phylogeny which highlights the similarity of Chinese to African isolates, and
      Ecuadorian to Hawaiian isolates. We used a measure of clustering, the adjusted
      Rand index, to extract region-specific SNPs and coding variation that can be used
      for diagnostics. The population genetics analysis we performed shows that the
      majority of sequence diversity is partitioned between populations, with diversity
      extremely low within China and East Africa.

AB  - Ecuadorians originated from a complex mixture of Native American indigenous
      people with Europeans and Africans. We analyzed Y-chromosome STRs (Y-STRs) in a
      sample of 415 Ecuadorians (145 using the AmpFlSTR((R)) Yfiler system [Life
      Technologies, USA] and 270 using the PowerPlex((R))Y23 system [Promega Corp.,
      USA]; hereafter Yfiler and PPY23, respectively) representing three main
      ecological continental regions of the country, namely Amazon rainforest, Andes,
      and Pacific coast. Diversity values are high in the three regions, and the PPY23 
      exhibits higher discrimination power than the Yfiler set. While summary
      statistics, AMOVA, and RST distances show low to moderate levels of population
      stratification, inferred ancestry derived from Y-STRs reveal clear patterns of
      geographic variation. The major ancestry in Ecuadorian males is European (61%),
      followed by an important Native American component (34%); whereas the African
      ancestry (5%) is mainly concentrated in the Northwest corner of the country. We
      conclude that classical procedures for measuring population stratification do not
      have the desirable sensitivity. Statistical inference of ancestry from Y-STRS is 
      a satisfactory alternative for revealing patterns of spatial variation that would
      pass unnoticed when using popular statistical summary indices.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe a clinical case of Klebsiella pneumoniae harboring a New 
      Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) plasmid in Ecuador and to present a map of
      reports of NDM isolates in South America. METHODS: The modified Hodge test,
      carbapenem inactivation method, imipenem-EDTA disk method (synergy), and Rapidec 
      Carba NP test were used to identify antibiotic resistance mechanisms. The
      presence of resistance genes was explored with a conjugation assay, and molecular
      confirmation of NDM was performed by PCR and DNA sequencing. Plasmid
      characterization was conducted by PCR-based replicon typing. A literature review 
      was performed in Google Scholar and PubMed to identify reports from South
      America. RESULTS: An HIV-infected patient, who had never traveled abroad,
      developed a bloodstream infection caused by K. pneumoniae ST147 harboring the
      NDM-1 resistance gene in a plasmid from the IncA/C group. Local circulation of
      NDM has also been described in other South American countries, in particular in
      Colombia and Brazil, although published scientific records were not found for
      other countries. CONCLUSIONS: This report presents the first evidence of
      autochthonous circulation of the NDM-1 resistance gene harbored by an IncA/C
      plasmid isolated from a K. pneumoniae ST147 in Ecuador. Efforts should be
      implemented to monitor and characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of 
      NDM in Ecuador and other countries of South America.

TI  - Distribution of triatomine species in domestic and peridomestic environments in
      central coastal Ecuador.
PG  - e0005970
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005970 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the central coast of the Ecuador is considered endemic for
      Chagas disease, few studies have focused on determining the risk of transmission 
      in this region. In this study we describe the triatomine household infestation in
      Manabi province (Central Coast region), determine the rate of Trypanosoma cruzi
      infection and study the risk factors associated with infestation by Rhodnius
      ecuadoriensis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An entomological survey found
      three triatomine species (Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus 
      and P. howardi) infesting domiciles in 47.4% of the 78 communities visited (total
      infestation rate of 4.5%). Four percent of domiciles were infested, and nymphs
      were observed in 77% of those domiciles. The three species were found in
      altitudes below 500 masl and in all ecological zones except cloud forest. Within 
      the domicile, we found the three species mostly in bedrooms. Rhodnius
      ecuadoriensis and P. rufotuberculatus were abundant in bird nests, including
      chicken coops and P. howardi associated with rats in piles of bricks, in the
      peridomicile. Triatomine infestation was characterized by high rates of
      colonization, especially in peridomicile. Flagelates infection was detected in
      only 12% of the samples by microscopy and Trypanosoma cruzi infection in 42% of
      the examined triatomines by PCR (n = 372). The most important risk factors for
      house infestation by R. ecuadoriensis were ecological zone (w = 0.99) and
      presence of chickens (w = 0.96). Determinants of secondary importance were
      reporting no insecticide applications over the last twelve months (w = 0.86) and 
      dirt floor (w = 0.70). On the other hand, wood as wall material was a protective 
      factor (w = 0.85). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: According the results, approximately 
      571,000 people would be at high risk for T. cruzi infection in Manabi province. A
      multidisciplinary approximation and the adhesion to a periodic integrated vector 
      management (IVM) program are essential to guarantee sustainable preventive and
      control strategies for Chagas disease in this region.

TI  - The effects of dissociation on willingness to eat meat are moderated by exposure

AB  - Dissociating meat from its animal origins helps consumers deal with the cognitive
      dissonance resulting from liking meat but disliking causing pain to animals.
      Extending previous research, we tested whether dissociation would play less of a 
      role for meat consumption in a country where average consumers are more
      frequently exposed to unprocessed meat (i.e., Ecuador) than where such exposure
      is rare (i.e., the US). Specifically, we randomly showed Ecuadorians and US
      Americans a pork roast with the head present or removed. Showing the head led to 
      less dissociation, and subsequently more disgust and empathy for the killed
      animal in both countries, but to significantly larger degrees in the US.
      Follow-up analyses with participants' self-reported exposure to unprocessed meat 
      supported the notion that these cross-cultural variations indeed reflected
      differences in unprocessed meat exposure. In contrast, disgust and empathy, in
      turn, predicted a lower willingness to eat meat and a higher willingness to
      choose a vegetarian alternative dish equally in both countries. Because the
      dissociation part of our model was substantially stronger in the US, it explained
      about double as much variance in willingness to eat meat and vegetarian choice in
      the US (63-72%) as compared to Ecuador (30-32%). In sum, the potency of the
      dissociation mechanism seems to depend on how used consumers in a country are to 
      seeing unprocessed meat, whereas the subsequent affective mechanisms universally 
      influence meat consumption.

TI  - The Cricotopus (Oliveiriella) (Diptera: Chironomidae) of the High Altitude Andean
      Streams, with Description of a New Species, C. (O.) rieradevallae.
PG  - 256-270
LID - 10.1007/s13744-017-0548-5 [doi]
AB  - The genus Oliveiriella (Chironomidae, Orthocladiinae) was erected by Wiedenbrug &
      Fittkau (1997). The adults have characteristic black spots on their wings and
      other characteristics similar to the genus Cricotopus. Pupal skins are very
      characteristic with strong short spines in the anal lobe instead of setae, while 
      larvae are distinguishable by the long anal papillae and the intense blue color
      of their body. However, Andersen et al (2013) consider Oliveiriella as a
      subgenera of Cricotopus. In this paper, using the sequences of the cox1 gene, we 
      conclude that Oliveiriella should be considered a subgenus within Cricotopus,
      confirming its status in Andersen et al (2013). Furthermore, we describe
      Cricotopus (Oliveiriella) rieradevallae Prat & Paggi sp. n. from the Saltana
      river (Ecuador). The adult males, females, and preimaginal stages of the two
      species of subgenus Oliveiriella known from South America Cricotopus (O.)
      almeidai n. comb. from Peru, Brazil, and Argentina and Cricotopus (O.) sanjavieri
      n. comb. from Argentina are compared with those of Cricotopus (O.) rieradevallae 
      sp. n. from Ecuador. The differences allow the distinction of the three species. 
      The cox1 gene reveals that at least three different undescribed species of the
      same subgenus are present in the high-altitude tropical Andes. The morphology of 
      the available pupae and pupal exuviae reveals the presence of several morphotypes
      that are candidates to be described as new species. A key used to distinguish
      these pupal morphotypes is provided, including the three described species.
      Additionally, the distribution of the subgenus is discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many patients with asthma use inhalers incorrectly. Better inhaler 
      technique is associated with better asthma control. We tested the effectiveness
      of a computer-based video training solution versus traditional written
      instructions, both which may be used in a resource-limited setting, for teaching 
      inhaler technique. We hypothesized that computer based training will provide a
      higher quality of instruction which will improve technique more effectively than 
      written training. METHODS: 50 asthma patients were recruited from pulmonary
      clinic at the Junta De Beneficencia Hospital, Ecuador (average age 48.2 years,
      58% female). Inhaler technique was taught using written instructions in 20 and
      video in 30 patients. Inhaler technique was analyzed by video recording pre and
      post training inhaler use. Inhaler technique score was calculated for each video 
      recording. RESULTS: Baseline performance was equivalent in each group, achieving 
      an average of around 5 of 11 of the inhaler steps. Video training was
      significantly more effective than written instructions (change of 3.6 points vs. 
      change of 0.4 points, p < 0.001), and improved inhaler technique by 70% (8.6 vs
      5.03, p < 0.001); written training did not result in a significant increase in
      inhaler competency (5.9 vs. 5.5, p = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that written
      instruction appears to be inadequate to achieve safe and effective administration
      of inhaled medicine. In contrast, video-based education can effectively create
      adequate inhaler technique without additional provider time. REGISTRATION NUMBER

LID - 10.1111/hsc.12478 [doi]
AB  - Migrant populations are under-represented in health research. We conducted a
      community-based qualitative study with the aim to examine the willingness,
      barriers, facilitators and reasons for participating in longitudinal health
      research among migrants. In Badalona and Santa Coloma de Gramanet (Barcelona)
      from May to November 2014, 26 individual interviews and 8 discussion groups were 
      conducted with a convenience sample of 76 migrants born in Colombia, Peru,
      Ecuador, Bolivia, Morocco, Pakistan and China; and 9 key informants. Grounded
      Theory methods and thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Atlas-ti(R)
      software was used. Participants were willing to participate in health surveys and
      biological samples testing, and agreed to be re-contacted after 12 months.
      Participants agreed to the same participation for their children. Participants
      reported that undertaking biological samples and knowledge of the health status
      of their children were the greatest benefits of participation in health research.
      Barriers to participation reported by participants were language difficulties,
      time constraints and mobility issues. Facilitators of participation included
      offering complete and understandable information about the study objectives and
      procedures; offering interviewers with the same migrant background, gender,
      country of origin and socioeconomic status as participants; building trust
      through ensuring proximity, privacy and confidentiality; respecting cultural
      relationships; and receiving monetary compensation and test results. Focusing on 
      migrant families instead of individuals may facilitate participation in the
      study. Despite being beneficial in general, receipt of monetary compensation,
      inclusion of questions related to sexual and reproductive health, and blood
      sample testing resulted in distrust for a small number of participants. The
      simultaneous use of several Internet tools was the most recommended tool for
      re-contact. Those with higher risk of mobility, greater language barriers and
      less Internet use were more difficult to re-contact. Study findings will help to 
      improve participation and retention of migrants in longitudinal research.

AB  - Haemoproteus (Haemoproteus) multipigmentatus, a haemosporidian parasite thought
      to be specific to columbiform birds, was detected in passeriform birds on
      Santiago Island in the Galapagos archipelago. We surveyed birds along an
      altitudinal gradient on the islands of Santa Cruz, Isabela and Santiago between
      June 2013 and July 2015. Molecular screening of 2254 individuals from 25 species 
      of endemic and introduced birds revealed clusters of passerine birds positive for
      H. multipigmentatus on Santiago Island that coincide with captures of Galapagos
      doves at sampled sites. Of 507 individuals from 10 species of endemic passerines 
      sampled on Santiago, 58 individuals from 6 species were found positive (11%
      prevalence). However, no gametocytes were found in the blood smears of positive
      passerines, suggesting that these species are not competent hosts for the
      parasite. All 31 doves captured were positive and gametocytes were found upon
      microscopic examination of all thin blood smears (averaging 357 gametocytes per
      10,000 erythrocytes). These findings indicate parasite spillover from doves to
      passerines, but that passerines are possibly not competent hosts for further
      parasite transmission. The endemic Galapagos dove acts as a reservoir host for
      the introduced H. multipigmentatus, however the effect of this parasite on
      passerines has not been studied. We report on these findings because parasites
      can have large effects on individual host populations and on the ecology of a
      community, but may go undetected.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the main factors determining the health related quality of
      life (HRQL) in patients with cancer-related neuropathic pain in a tertiary care
      hospital. METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical study was performed on a sample
      of 237 patients meeting criteria for cancer-related neuropathic pain. Clinical
      and demographic variables were recorded including, cancer type, stage, time since
      diagnosis, pain intensity, physical functionality with the Palliative Performance
      Scale (PPS), and anxiety and depression with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale (HADS). Their respective correlation coefficients (r) with HRQL assessed
      with the SF-36v2 Questionnaire were then calculated. Linear regression equations 
      were then constructed with the variables that showed an r>/=.5 with the HRQL.
      RESULTS: The HRQL scores of the sample were 39.3+/-9.1 (Physical Component) and
      45.5+/-13.8 (Mental Component). Anxiety and depression strongly correlated with
      the mental component (r=-.641 and r=-.741, respectively) while PPS score
      correlated with the physical component (r=.617). The linear regression model that
      better explained the variance of the mental component was designed combining the 
      Anxiety and Depression variables (R=77.3%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The strong
      influence of psychiatric comorbidity on the HRQL of patients with cancer-related 
      neuropathic pain makes an integral management plan essential for these patients
      to include interventions for its timely diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - 2b-RAD genotyping for population genomic studies of Chagas disease vectors:
      Rhodnius ecuadoriensis in Ecuador.
PG  - e0005710
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005710 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhodnius ecuadoriensis is the main triatomine vector of Chagas
      disease, American trypanosomiasis, in Southern Ecuador and Northern Peru. Genomic
      approaches and next generation sequencing technologies have become powerful tools
      for investigating population diversity and structure which is a key consideration
      for vector control. Here we assess the effectiveness of three different 2b
      restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) genotyping strategies in R.
      ecuadoriensis to provide sufficient genomic resolution to tease apart
      microevolutionary processes and undertake some pilot population genomic analyses.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The 2b-RAD protocol was carried out in-house at a
      non-specialized laboratory using 20 R. ecuadoriensis adults collected from the
      central coast and southern Andean region of Ecuador, from June 2006 to July 2013.
      2b-RAD sequencing data was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument and analyzed
      with the STACKS de novo pipeline for loci assembly and Single Nucleotide
      Polymorphism (SNP) discovery. Preliminary population genomic analyses (global
      AMOVA and Bayesian clustering) were implemented. Our results showed that the
      2b-RAD genotyping protocol is effective for R. ecuadoriensis and likely for other
      triatomine species. However, only BcgI and CspCI restriction enzymes provided a
      number of markers suitable for population genomic analysis at the read depth we
      generated. Our preliminary genomic analyses detected a signal of genetic
      structuring across the study area. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest
      that 2b-RAD genotyping is both a cost effective and methodologically simple
      approach for generating high resolution genomic data for Chagas disease vectors
      with the power to distinguish between different vector populations at
      epidemiologically relevant scales. As such, 2b-RAD represents a powerful tool in 
      the hands of medical entomologists with limited access to specialized molecular
      biological equipment.

TI  - Parallel body shape divergence in the Neotropical fish genus Rhoadsia (Teleostei:
      Characidae) along elevational gradients of the western slopes of the Ecuadorian
      Andes.
PG  - e0179432
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0179432 [doi]
AB  - Neotropical mountain streams are important contributors of biological diversity. 
      Two species of the characid genus Rhoadsia differing for an ecologically
      important morphological trait, body depth, have been described from mountain
      streams of the western slopes of the Andes in Ecuador. Rhoadsia altipinna is a
      deeper-bodied species reported from low elevations in southwestern Ecuador and
      northern Peru, and Rhoadsia minor is a more streamlined species that was
      described from high elevations (>1200 m) in the Esmeraldas drainage in
      northwestern Ecuador. Little is known about these species and their validity as
      distinct species has been questioned. In this study, we examine how their body
      shape varies along replicated elevational gradients in different drainages of
      western Ecuador using geometric morphometrics and the fineness ratio. We also use
      sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c I gene and the second intron 
      of the S7 nuclear gene to examine whether genetic data are consistent with the
      existence of two species. We found that body depth varies continuously among
      populations within drainages as a function of elevation, and that body shape
      overlaps among drainages, such that low elevation populations of R. minor in the 
      Esmeraldas drainage have similar body depths to higher elevation R. altipinna in 
      southern drainages. Although a common general trend of declining body depth with 
      elevation is clear, the pattern and magnitude of body shape divergence differed
      among drainages. Sequencing of mitochondrial and nuclear genes failed to meet
      strict criteria for the recognition of two species (e.g., reciprocal monophyly
      and deep genetic structure). However, there was a large component of genetic
      variation for the COI gene that segregated among drainages, indicating
      significant genetic divergence associated with geographic isolation. Continued
      research on Rhoadsia in western Ecuador may yield significant insight into
      adaptation and speciation in Neotropical mountain streams.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer induces a substantial global burden. We examined its global
      incidence/mortality rates and their correlation with socioeconomic development
      (Human Development Index [HDI] and Gross Domestic Product [GDP] in 2000 as proxy 
      measures). Data on age-standardized incidence/mortality rates in 2012 were
      retrieved from the GLOBOCAN database. Temporal patterns in 1998-2007 were
      assessed for 39 countries according to gender. The Average Annual Percent Change 
      (AAPC) of the incidence/mortality trends was evaluated using joinpoint regression
      analysis. The age-standardized incidence ranged between 0.8-8.9/100,000. When
      compared among countries, Brazil (AAPC = 10.4, 95%C.I. = 0.8,21) and France (AAPC
      = 4.7, 95%C.I. = 3.6,5.9) reported the highest incidence rise in men. The
      greatest increase in women was reported in Thailand (AAPC = 7, 95%C.I. =
      2.1,12.1) and Ecuador (AAPC = 4.3, 95%C.I. = 1.3,7.3). For mortality, the
      Philippines (APCC = 4.3, 95%C.I. = 2,6.6) and Croatia (AAPC = 2, 95% C.I. =
      0,3.9) reported the biggest increase among men. The Philippines (AAPC = 5.8, 95% 
      C.I. 4.5,7.2) and Slovakia (AAPC = 3.1, 95% C.I. 0.9,5.3) showed the most
      prominent rise among women. Its incidence was positively correlated with HDI
      (men: r = 0.66; women: r = 0.70) and GDP (men: r = 0.29; women: r = 0.28, all p <
      0.05), and similarly for mortality (men: r = 0.67; women: r = 0.72 [HDI]; men: r 
      = 0.23; women: r = 0.28 [GDP]). In summary, the incidence and mortality of
      pancreatic cancer were rising in many countries, requiring regular surveillance.

AB  - Effective control of Chagas disease vector populations requires a good
      understanding of the epidemiological components, including a reliable analysis of
      the genetic structure of vector populations. Rhodnius ecuadoriensis is the most
      widespread vector of Chagas disease in Ecuador, occupying domestic, peridomestic 
      and sylvatic habitats. It is widely distributed in the central coast and southern
      highlands regions of Ecuador, two very different regions in terms of
      bio-geographical characteristics. To evaluate the genetic relationship among R.
      ecuadoriensis populations in these two regions, we analyzed genetic variability
      at two microsatellite loci for 326 specimens (n=122 in Manabi and n=204 in Loja) 
      and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Cyt b) sequences for 174 individuals
      collected in the two provinces (n=73 and=101 in Manabi and Loja respectively).
      The individual samples were grouped in populations according to their community
      of origin. A few populations presented positive FIS, possible due to Wahlund
      effect. Significant pairwise differentiation was detected between populations
      within each province for both genetic markers, and the isolation by distance
      model was significant for these populations. Microsatellite markers showed
      significant genetic differentiation between the populations of the two provinces.
      The partial sequences of the Cyt b gene (578bp) identified a total of 34
      haplotypes among 174 specimens sequenced, which translated into high haplotype
      diversity (Hd=0.929). The haplotype distribution differed among provinces
      (significant Fisher's exact test). Overall, the genetic differentiation of R.
      ecuadoriensis between provinces detected in this study is consistent with the
      biological and phenotypic differences previously observed between Manabi and Loja
      populations. The current phylogenetic analysis evidenced the monophyly of the
      populations of R. ecuadoriensis within the R. pallescens species complex; R.
      pallescens and R. colombiensis were more closely related than they were to R.
      ecuadoriensis.

TI  - The current status of resistance to alpha-cypermethrin, ivermectin, and amitraz
      of the cattle tick (Rhipicephalus microplus) in Ecuador.
PG  - e0174652
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0174652 [doi]
AB  - Rhipicephalus microplus is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas
      of the world where livestock is a principal activity with great veterinary and
      economic importance. In Ecuador, this hematophagous ectoparasite has been
      observed between 0 and 2600 masl. One of the main tick control measures is the
      use of acaricides, which have been indiscriminately used worldwide and in
      Ecuador. In this country, no studies on acaricide resistance in Rhipicephalus
      microplus have been published. The current study aims to characterise the level
      of resistance of R. microplus against three main acaricides commonly used in
      Ecuador i.e. amitraz, alpha-cypermethrin and ivermectin to determine the level
      and pattern of dose-responses for R. microplus in 12 field populations (farms).
      The level of acaricide resistance was evaluated using three different bioassays: 
      adult immersion test (AIT), larval package test (LPT) and larval immersion test
      (LIT), as recommended by the FAO. The predictive dose-responses were analysed by 
      binomial logistics regression of the larval survival rate (resistance). In
      general, we found resistance of 67% for amitraz; 50% for alpha-cypermethrin and
      from 25 to 42% for ivermectin in the twelve field populations analysed.
      Resistance levels were studied in larval and adult bioassays, respectively, which
      were slightly modified for this study. For larval bioassays based on corrected
      mortality i.e. high (above 51%), medium (21-50%) and low (11-20%) resistance,
      percentages less than 10% were considered as susceptible. For the adult test, two
      resistance levels were used i.e. high (more than 76%) and medium (51 to 75%)
      resistance. Percentages lower than 50% were considered as susceptible. In this
      context, for larval bioassays, amitraz showed 21%, 38% and 8% for high, medium
      and low resistance, respectively. Alpha-cypermethrin presented 8%, 4 and 38% for 
      high, medium and low resistance, respectively. Ivermectin presented 8%, 25% and
      8% for high, medium and low resistance, respectively. For adult tests with
      amitraz 50% and 17% of the field populations showed average and high resistance, 
      with evidences of average resistance to alpha-cypermethrin in 50% of the samples 
      and average resistance against ivermectin in 25% of the farms. No statistical
      difference amongst the three bioassays was found and acaricide resistance was
      confirmed by logistic regression analysis; hence resistance (dose-responses) in
      each field populations differed, depending on the choice of the acaricide,
      frequent usage, frequency of treatment and farm management. The effective
      estimated dose needed to eliminate 99% of ticks is higher than dose recommended
      by the manufacturer. In conclusion, amitraz showed the highest resistance
      followed by ivermectin and alpha-cypermethrin and reveals differences on
      resistance in each individual field population. This information is important in 
      order to establish the monitoring of resistance on each farm individually,
      contributing to the rational use of acaricides included in an integrated control 
      program for R. microplus.

TI  - Preliminary Studies of the Performance of Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.)
      Genotypes under Irrigated and Rainfed Conditions of Central Malawi.

AB  - The goal of sustainable intensification of agriculture in Malawi has led to the
      evaluation of innovative, regionally novel or under-utilized crop species. Quinoa
      (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) has the potential to provide a drought tolerant,
      nutritious alternative to maize. We evaluated 11 diverse varieties of quinoa for 
      their yield and agronomic performance at two locations, Bunda and Bembeke, in
      Malawi. The varieties originated from Ecuador, Chile and Bolivia in South
      America; the United States and Canada in North America; and, Denmark in Europe,
      and were chosen based on their variation in morphological and agronomic traits,
      and their potential for adaptation to the climate of Malawi. Plant height,
      panicle length, days to maturity, harvest index, and seed yield were recorded for
      each variety under irrigation at Bunda and Bembeke, and under rainfed conditions 
      at Bunda. Plant height was significantly influenced by both genotype and
      environment. There were also significant differences between the two locations
      for panicle length whereas genotype and genotype x environment (G x E)
      interaction were not significantly different. Differences were found for genotype
      and G x E interaction for harvest index. Notably, differences for genotype,
      environment and G x E were found for grain yield. Seed yield was higher at Bunda 
      (237-3019 kg/ha) than Bembeke (62-692 kg/ha) under irrigated conditions. The
      highest yielding genotype at Bunda was Titicaca (3019 kg/ha) whereas Multi-Hued
      was the highest (692 kg/ha) at Bembeke. Strong positive correlations between seed
      yield and (1) plant height (r = 0.74), (2) days to maturity (r = 0.76), and (3)
      biomass (r = 0.87) were found under irrigated conditions. The rainfed evaluations
      at Bunda revealed significant differences in seed yield, plant biomass, and seed 
      size among the genotypes. The highest yielding genotype was Black Seeded (2050
      kg/ha) followed by Multi-Hued (1603 kg/ha) and Bio-Bio (1446 kg/ha). Ecuadorian
      (257 kg/ha) was the lowest yielding genotype. In general the seed yields of the
      genotypes were lower under rainfed conditions than under irrigated conditions at 
      Bunda. The results also highlight the need to continue evaluating a diverse
      number of cultivars to select for genotypes adapted to specific agro-ecological
      areas and across seasons in Malawi.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0171687 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Latin America, community-acquired pneumonia remains a major cause 
      of morbidity and mortality among children. Few studies have examined the etiology
      of pneumonia in Ecuador. METHODS: This observational study was part of a
      randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted among
      children aged 2-59 months with severe pneumonia in Quito, Ecuador. Nasopharyngeal
      and blood samples were tested for bacterial and viral etiology by polymerase
      chain reaction. Risk factors for specific respiratory pathogens were also
      evaluated. RESULTS: Among 406 children tested, 159 (39.2%) had respiratory
      syncytial virus (RSV), 71 (17.5%) had human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and 62
      (15.3%) had adenovirus. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 37 (9.2%)
      samples and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in three (0.74%) samples. The yearly
      circulation pattern of RSV (P = 0.0003) overlapped with S. pneumoniae, (P = 0.03)
      with most cases occurring in the rainy season. In multivariable analysis, risk
      factors for RSV included younger age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.9, P = 0.01) 
      and being underweight (aOR = 1.8, P = 0.04). Maternal education (aOR = 0.82, P = 
      0.003), pulse oximetry (aOR = 0.93, P = 0.005), and rales (aOR = 0.25, P = 0.007)
      were associated with influenza A. Younger age (aOR = 3.5, P = 0.007) and elevated
      baseline respiratory rate were associated with HPIV-3 infection (aOR = 0.94, P = 
      0.03). CONCLUSION: These results indicate the importance of RSV and influenza,
      and potentially modifiable risk factors including undernutrition and future use
      of a RSV vaccine, when an effective vaccine becomes available. TRIAL

TI  - Cesarean section rates in Ecuador: a 13-year comparative analysis between public 
      and private health systems.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the prevalence of cesearean sections (C-sections) in
      Ecuador and their distribution between private and public health centers.
      METHODS: An observational population-based study was conducted of patients
      discharged from public and private hospitals in Ecuador after a C-section or
      vaginal delivery. Data were collected by the Ecuadorian National Institute of
      Statistics and Census (INEC) between 2001 and 2013. RESULTS: The overall national
      C-section rate in the private health care system is double the rate in the public
      health care system. Over the 13 years of the study, C-sections accounted for
      57.5% of births in the private sector, while the public sector proportion did not
      exceed 22.3%. Countrywide, less than 36% of C-sections were found to be
      clinically justified by parallel analysis of absolute or relative indications.
      Acute fetal distress (AFD) was more frequently reported in private centers
      compared to public ones (446 per 10 000 live births versus 274 per 10 000). Since
      2001, the number of births by cesarean section increased by more than 50% (R(2) =
      0.7306, P < 0.05), with an annual growth rate of 4.03%. In Guayaquil, the largest
      city in Ecuador, up to 74% of live births occurred by C-section. CONCLUSION:
      National data show that C-sections are performed more frequently in Ecuador than 
      the rate recommended by the World Health Organization, especially in the private 
      health care system. Private centers also report higher rates of AFD, which
      implies that this diagnosis is either overused in private centers or
      underrecognized in public centers. Although several factors might be influencing 
      these trends, no data are available to determine the relative importance of
      economics, practicality, and medical or personal concerns of mothers and
      physicians in deciding which method of delivery should be used.

TI  - The modern morphometric approach to identify eggs of Triatominae.
PG  - 55
LID - 10.1186/s13071-017-1982-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Egg morphometrics in the Triatominae has proved to be informative for
      distinguishing tribes or genera, and has been based generally on traditional
      morphometrics. However, more resolution is required, allowing species or even
      population recognition, because the presence of eggs in the domicile could be
      related to the species ability to colonize human dwellings, suggesting its
      importance as a vector. RESULTS: We explored the resolution of modern
      morphometric methods to distinguish not only tribes and genera, but also species 
      or geographic populations in some important Triatominae. Four species were
      considered, representing two tribes and three genera: Panstrongylus chinai and P.
      howardi, Triatoma carrioni and Rhodnius ecuadoriensis. Within R. ecuadoriensis,
      two geographical populations of Ecuador were compared. For these comparisons, we 
      selected the most suitable day of egg development, as well as the possible best
      position of the egg for data capture. The shape of the eggs in the Triatominae
      does not offer true anatomical landmarks as the ones used in landmark-based
      morphometrics, except for the egg cap, especially in eggs with an evident "neck",
      such as those of the Rhodniini. To capture the operculum shape variation, we used
      the landmark- and semilandmark-based method. The results obtained from the metric
      properties of the operculum were compared with the ones provided by the simple
      contour of the whole egg, as analyzed by the Elliptic Fourier Analysis. Clear
      differences could be disclosed between the genera, between the species - among
      which two very close species (P. chinai and P. howardi), as well as between two
      allopatric, conspecific populations. The whole egg contour (including the
      operculum) produced reclassification scores much more satisfactory than the ones 
      obtained using the operculum only. CONCLUSIONS: We propose the outline-based
      approach as the most convenient characterization tool to identify unknown eggs at
      the species or population levels.

TI  - Validity of a PCR assay in CSF for the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis.
PG  - e324
LID - 10.1212/NXI.0000000000000324 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the validity of a PCR assay in CSF for the
      diagnosis of neurocysticercosis (NC). METHODS: We conducted a multicenter,
      prospective case-control study, recruiting participants from 5 hospitals in
      Cuenca, Ecuador, from January 2015 to February 2016. Cases fulfilled validated
      diagnostic criteria for NC. For each case, a neurosurgical patient who did not
      fulfill the diagnostic criteria for NC was selected as a control. CT and MRI, as 
      well as a CSF sample, were collected from both cases and controls. The diagnostic
      criteria to identify cases were used as a reference standard. RESULTS: Overall,
      36 case and 36 control participants were enrolled. PCR had a sensitivity of 72.2%
      (95% confidence interval [CI] 54.8%-85.8%) and a specificity of 100.0% (95% CI
      90.3%-100.0%). For parenchymal NC, PCR had a sensitivity of 42.9% (95% CI
      17.7%-71.1%), and for extraparenchymal NC, PCR had a sensitivity of 90.9% (95% CI
      70.8%-98.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the usefulness of this PCR
      assay in CSF for the diagnosis of NC. PCR may be particularly helpful for
      diagnosing extraparenchymal NC when neuroimaging techniques have failed.
      CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that CSF PCR
      can accurately identify patients with extraparenchymal NC.

TI  - Manta birostris, predator of the deep? Insight into the diet of the giant manta
      ray through stable isotope analysis.
PG  - 160717
LID - 10.1098/rsos.160717 [doi]
AB  - The characterization of diet for the giant manta ray Manta birostris has been
      problematic given their large-scale movement patterns and the difficulty in
      obtaining stomach contents from this species. The large majority of existing
      information is based on observational data limited to feeding events at the sea
      surface during daylight. Recently discovered aggregation sites for the giant
      manta ray off mainland Ecuador are some of the most accessible to date and
      provide a unique opportunity for researchers to gather much needed information on
      this elusive species. To assess how important surface zooplankton is to giant
      manta ray diet, we conducted stable isotope analysis ((15)N and (13)C) on M.
      birostris muscle and surface zooplankton. Trophic position estimates placed M.
      birostris overall at a secondary consumer level of approximately 3.4 but there
      was large variation in delta(15)N and delta(13)C values among individuals. Manta 
      birostris muscle tissue delta(13)C values were also not consistent with this
      species feeding predominantly on surface zooplankton and suggest that the
      majority of dietary intake is of mesopelagic origin. Given the conservative life 
      history and fisheries pressure on large planktivores, knowledge of their trophic 
      role and foraging strategies is essential to better understand their ecology and 
      develop effective conservation measures.

AB  - A new isopod was found parasitizing Chaetostoma breve and Chaetostoma microps
      from the Puyo and Bobonaza rivers. The parasite found belongs to the Cymothoidae 
      family and could be located within the genus Riggia instead of Artystone by the
      presence of abdominal plates fused with the telson. The specimens found represent
      a new species, Riggia puyensis n. sp., and could be distinguished from Riggia
      cryptocularis by the presence of developed eyes. The main difference of the new
      specie from Riggia nana and Riggia brasiliensis is the size, bigger compared with
      the first and smaller compared with the last species. Riggia acuticaudata have
      the maxilliped with simple setae, the palp without spination, and maxillule with 
      five spines (two terminal and three subterminal) instead in R. puyensis n. sp.
      the maxilliped have plumose setae, the palp have spination (with one apical
      spine, two setae on middle article and one in the basal article) and the
      maxillule have five spines: two terminal, two subterminal and other spine lower
      to the others. Riggia paranaensis have similar size, same number of segments in
      the antena, and similar maxilla to R. puyensis n. sp., but the antennule in the
      new specie have seven segments instead 6 in R. paranaensis, the antennule and
      antenna present spines not mentioned in R. paranaensis. Besides, the relative
      position of the mandible in R. puyensis n. sp. is different compared with R.
      paranaensis, the maxillule have the same number of spines but with different
      disposition, and the maxilliped have simple setae in R. paranaensis but those are
      plumose in the new specie.

TI  - Genetic Bottlenecks for Two Populations of Ceratocystis fimbriata on Sweet Potato

AB  - Chinese isolates of Ceratocystis fimbriata from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas)
      and pomegranate (Punica granatum) were genetically compared with a worldwide
      collection of isolates from a variety of hosts. Isolates from black-rotted
      storage roots of sweet potato in China, Japan, Australasia, and the United States
      had identical internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences
      and only minor variation in microsatellite alleles. Sequences of their mating
      type genes were most similar to those of isolates from various hosts in Ecuador, 
      a center of diversity for sweet potato. Isolates from Colocasia esculenta (taro) 
      and pomegranate from Yunnan and Sichuan had only one ITS rDNA sequence (haplotype
      ITS5). This haplotype, sequences of mating type genes, and microsatellite alleles
      linked these isolates to isolates from Eucalyptus stumps in South China and
      diseased Eucalyptus trees in Brazil, supporting the hypothesis that the
      pomegranate population originated from Brazil via cuttings of Eucalyptus.
      Isolates from sweet potato and pomegranate in China were interfertile with tester
      strains of C. fimbriata, confirming that the causes of the two epidemics in China
      belong to a single biological species. However, other isolates from Eucalyptus
      stumps were intersterile with the tester strains and had ITS rDNA sequences
      typical of the Asian species, C. cercfabiensis.

AB  - Oswaldocruzia chambrieri Ben Slimane et Durette-Desset, 1993 is redescribed from 
      specimens collected from the small intestine of the South American common toad,
      Rhinella margaritifera, from Caxiuana National Forest in Para, Brazil, using
      light and scanning microscopy and molecular analysis of Cytochrome Oxidase I
      (COI) - coding regions of DNA. The discovered nematodes are characterized by a
      type III caudal bursa with two papillae, rays 4 with a median groove, and
      spicules divided into a blade, a shoe and a fork. Cervical alae are absent, the
      cephalic vesicle is divided into two portions, and the synlophe has low ridges
      without chitinous supports. The present study establishes the Caxiuana National
      Forest as a new location for O. chambrieri, which had previously been reported as
      a parasite of R. margaritifera in Ecuador, uses light microscopy and scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM) to identify new morphological characters of the species
      and represents the second molecular sequence deposited for the Oswaldocruzia
      genus.

AB  - Human activity has facilitated the introduction of a number of alien mammal
      species to the Galapagos Archipelago. Understanding the phylogeographic history
      and population genetics of invasive species on the Archipelago is an important
      step in predicting future spread and designing effective management strategies.
      In this study, we describe the invasion pathway of Rattus rattus across the
      Galapagos using microsatellite data, coupled with historical knowledge.
      Microsatellite genotypes were generated for 581 R. rattus sampled from 15 islands
      in the archipelago. The genetic data suggest that there are at least three
      genetic lineages of R. rattus present on the Galapagos Islands. The spatial
      distributions of these lineages correspond to the main centers of human
      settlement in the archipelago. There was limited admixture among these three
      lineages, and these finding coupled with low rates of gene flow among island
      populations suggests that interisland movement of R. rattus is rare. The low
      migration among islands recorded for the species will have a positive impact on
      future eradication efforts.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is considered a necessary causative
      agent for developing oropharyngeal, anal and cervical cancer. Among women in
      Ecuadorian population, cervical cancer ranks as the second most common
      gynecological cancer. Not many studies about HPV burden have been published in
      Ecuador, and genotypes distribution has not been established yet. The little data
      available suggest the presence of other genotypes different than 16 and 18.
      OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we attempt to estimate the prevalence of HPV
      16, HPV 18 and other 35 genotypes among Ecuadorian women undergoing cervical
      cancer screening. The overall prevalence of HPV infection was also estimated.
      METHODS: Routine cervical samples were analyzed using Linear Array(r) HPV
      Genotyping test (Roche). RESULTS: A total of 1,581 cervical samples obtained from
      Ecuadorian women undergoing cervical cancer screening were included in this
      study. HPV DNA was detected in 689 cervical samples (43.58%). Of these samples,
      604 (38.20%) were positive for a single HPV genotype, while another 85 (5.37%)
      samples were positive for multiple HPV types. Genotype 16 (5.50%) resulted in the
      most frequently detected type in both single and multiple infections. HPV 33
      (4.55%) and HPV 11 (3.80%) occupied the second and the third place in frequency
      among all detected genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Viral genotypes different from HPV 16 
      and HPV 18 are frequently detected among Ecuadorian women. The overall prevalence
      of HPV resulted higher than the one reported in other South American countries
      with a greater burden in the second and third decades of life.

AB  - An air monitoring campaign to assess children's environmental exposures in
      schools and residences, both indoors and outdoors, was conducted in 2010 in three
      low-income neighborhoods in Z1 (north), Z2 (central), and Z3 (southeast) zones of
      Quito, Ecuador - a major urban center of 2.2 million inhabitants situated 2850 m 
      above sea level in a narrow mountainous basin. Z1 zone, located in northern
      Quito, historically experienced emissions from quarries and moderate traffic. Z2 
      zone was influenced by heavy traffic in contrast to Z3 zone which experienced low
      traffic densities. Weekly averages of PM samples were collected at schools (one
      in each zone) and residences (Z1 = 47, Z2 = 45, and Z3 = 41) every month, over a 
      twelve-month period at the three zones. Indoor PM2.5 concentrations ranged from
      10.6 +/- 4.9 mug/m(3) (Z1 school) to 29.0 +/- 30.5 mug/m(3) (Z1 residences) and
      outdoor PM2.5 concentrations varied from 10.9 +/- 3.2 mug/m(3) (Z1 school) to
      14.3 +/- 10.1 mug/m(3) (Z2 residences), across the three zones. The lowest values
      for PM10-2.5 for indoor and outdoor microenvironments were recorded at Z2 school,
      5.7 +/- 2.8 mug/m(3) and 7.9 +/- 2.2 mug/m(3), respectively. Outdoor school PM
      concentrations exhibited stronger associations with corresponding indoor values
      making them robust proxies for indoor exposures in naturally ventilated Quito
      public schools. Correlation analysis between the school and residential PM size
      fractions and the various pollutant and meteorological parameters from central
      ambient monitoring (CAM) sites suggested varying degrees of temporal
      relationship. Strong positive correlation was observed for outdoor PM2.5 at Z2
      school and its corresponding CAM site (r = 0.77) suggesting common traffic
      related emissions. Spatial heterogeneity in PM2.5 concentrations between CAM
      network and sampled sites was assessed using Coefficient of Divergence (COD)
      analysis. COD values were lower when CAM sites were paired with outdoor
      measurements (<0.2) and higher when CAM and indoor values were compared (>0.2),
      suggesting that CAM network in Quito may not represent actual indoor exposures.

AB  - AIMS: To determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and prediabetes in a
      population of the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, aged 55-65 years; to observe if
      there are differences in prevalence between males and females, and to describe
      the frequency with which each component of the metabolic syndrome is found in
      this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: population-based cross-sectional study in
      Guayaquil. We recruited people of both genders, with ages ranging from 55 to 65
      years. Through clinical history, physical examination and laboratory tests, we
      obtained necessary data to diagnose metabolic syndrome and/or prediabetes.
      Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS((R)) 22. RESULTS: we obtained a
      sample of 213 patients, 64.5% were females and 35.5% were males. Mean age was
      60.3 years (+/-3.1). A total 65.8% of patients had increased waist circumference,
      and 45% were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Hypertriglyceridemia was the most
      prevalent condition in males, while women more commonly had low HDL. Prediabetes 
      was diagnosed in 45.9% of our patients, and 19.5% had both disorders. There was
      no significant difference on metabolic syndrome prevalence between genders, but
      prediabetes was significantly more common in women. CONCLUSION: we found a high
      prevalence of metabolic syndrome and prediabetes in Guayaquil, higher than what
      was reported in other areas. Abdominal obesity is even more prevalent. Women have
      prediabetes more frequently than men. Our patients, given their age, are at
      higher risk of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline by having metabolic
      syndrome and/or prediabetes.

AB  - Elevated concentration of cadmium (Cd) in cacao beans has raised serious concerns
      about the chocolate consumption on human health. Accumulation of Cd in cacao bean
      in southern Ecuador has been related to soil contamination. In this study, soil
      fractionation approach was used to identify available Cd pools in the soils and
      to correlate these Cd pools with bean Cd concentration and soil test indexes. The
      distribution of soil Cd fractions decreased in the order: oxidizable >
      acid-soluble > residual > reducible >> water-soluble (+exchangeable). Oxidizable 
      and acid-soluble fractions accounted for 59 and 68% of the total recoverable Cd
      for the 0-5 and 5-15 cm soil depth, respectively. Acid-soluble fraction was
      closely related to bean-Cd, with correlation coefficients (r) of 0.70 and 0.81 (P
      < 0.01) for the 0-5 and 5-15 cm soil depth, respectively. Acid-soluble Cd was
      significantly correlated with 0.01 M HCl- (r = 0.99, P < 0.01) or Mehlich 3-
      extractable Cd (r = 0.97, P < 0.01). These results indicate that acid-soluble Cd 
      fraction is an important part of available Cd pool. Since approximately 60% of Cd
      in the cacao-growing soils is related to the acid-soluble fraction and bound to
      organic matter, remediation of the contaminated soils should consider to the
      dynamics of soil pH and organic matter content.

TI  - Local parasite lineage sharing in temperate grassland birds provides clues about 
      potential origins of Galapagos avian Plasmodium.
PG  - 716-26
LID - 10.1002/ece3.1894 [doi]
AB  - Oceanic archipelagos are vulnerable to natural introduction of parasites via
      migratory birds. Our aim was to characterize the geographic origins of two
      Plasmodium parasite lineages detected in the Galapagos Islands and in North
      American breeding bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) that regularly stop in
      Galapagos during migration to their South American overwintering sites. We used
      samples from a grassland breeding bird assemblage in Nebraska, United States, and
      parasite DNA sequences from the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, to compare to global 
      data in a DNA sequence registry. Homologous DNA sequences from parasites detected
      in bobolinks and more sedentary birds (e.g., brown-headed cowbirds Molothrus
      ater, and other co-occurring bird species resident on the North American breeding
      grounds) were compared to those recovered in previous studies from global sites. 
      One parasite lineage that matched between Galapagos birds and the migratory
      bobolink, Plasmodium lineage B, was the most common lineage detected in the
      global MalAvi database, matching 49 sequences from unique host/site combinations,
      41 of which were of South American origin. We did not detect lineage B in
      brown-headed cowbirds. The other Galapagos-bobolink match, Plasmodium lineage C, 
      was identical to two other sequences from birds sampled in California. We
      detected a close variant of lineage C in brown-headed cowbirds. Taken together,
      this pattern suggests that bobolinks became infected with lineage B on the South 
      American end of their migratory range, and with lineage C on the North American
      breeding grounds. Overall, we detected more parasite lineages in bobolinks than
      in cowbirds. Galapagos Plasmodium had similar host breadth compared to the
      non-Galapagos haemosporidian lineages detected in bobolinks, brown-headed
      cowbirds, and other grassland species. This study highlights the utility of
      global haemosporidian data in the context of migratory bird-parasite
      connectivity. It is possible that migratory bobolinks bring parasites to the
      Galapagos and that these parasites originate from different biogeographic regions
      representing both their breeding and overwintering sites.

TI  - Trophic ecology of sea urchins in coral-rocky reef systems, Ecuador.
PG  - e1578
LID - 10.7717/peerj.1578 [doi]
AB  - Sea urchins are important grazers and influence reef development in the Eastern
      Tropical Pacific (ETP). Diadema mexicanum and Eucidaris thouarsii are the most
      important sea urchins on the Ecuadorian coastal reefs. This study provided a
      trophic scenario for these two species of echinoids in the coral-rocky reef
      bottoms of the Ecuadorian coast, using stable isotopes. We evaluated the relative
      proportion of algal resources assimilated, and trophic niche of the two sea
      urchins in the most southern coral-rocky reefs of the ETP in two sites with
      different disturbance level. Bayesian models were used to estimate the
      contribution of algal sources, niche breadth, and trophic overlap between the two
      species. The sea urchins behaved as opportunistic feeders, although they showed
      differential resource assimilation. Eucidaris thouarsii is the dominant species
      in disturbed environments; likewise, their niche amplitude was broader than that 
      of D. mexicanum when conditions were not optimal. However, there was no niche
      overlap between the species. The Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) indicated
      that both sea urchins shared limiting resources in the disturbed area, mainly
      Dictyota spp. (contributions of up to 85% for D. mexicanum and up to 75% for E.
      thouarsii). The Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R (SIBER) analysis results
      indicated less interspecific competition in the undisturbed site. Our results
      suggested a trophic niche partitioning between sympatric sea urchin species in
      coastal areas of the ETP, but the limitation of resources could lead to trophic
      overlap and stronger habitat degradation.

TI  - Emergency Department of a Rural Hospital in Ecuador.
PG  - 66-72
LID - 10.5811/westjem.2015.11.27936 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of data studying patients and complaints
      presenting to emergency departments (EDs) in low- and middle-income countries.
      The town of Pedro Vicente Maldonado (PVM) is located in the northwestern
      highlands of Ecuador. Hospital PVM (HPVM) is a rural teaching hospital providing 
      family medicine residency training. These physicians provide around-the-clock
      acute medical care in HPVM's ED. This study provides a first look at a
      functioning ED in rural Latin America by reviewing one year of ED visits to HPVM.
      METHODS: All ED visits between April 14, 2013, and April 13, 2014, were included 
      and analyzed, totaling 1,239 patient visits. Data were collected from their
      electronic medical record and exported into a de-identified Excel(R) database
      where it was sorted and categorized. Variables included age, gender, mode of
      arrival, insurance type, month and day of the week of the service, chief
      complaint, laboratory and imaging requests, and disposition. We performed
      descriptive statistics, and where possible, comparisons using Student's T or
      chi-square, as appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 1239 total ED visits, 48% were males 
      and 52% females; 93% of the visits were ambulatory, and 7% came by ambulance.
      Sixty-three percent of the patients had social security insurance. The top three 
      chief complaints were abdominal pain (25.5%), fever (15.1%) and trauma (10.8%).
      Healthcare providers requested labs on 71.3% of patients and imaging on 43.2%.
      The most frequently requested imaging studies were chest radiograph (14.9%),
      upper extremity radiograph (9.4%), and electrocardiogram (9.0%). There was no
      seasonal or day-of-week variability to number of ED patients. The chief complaint
      of human or animal bite made it more likely the patient would be admitted, and
      the chief complaint of traumatic injury made it more likely the patient would be 
      transferred. CONCLUSION: Analysis of patients presenting to a rural ED in Ecuador
      contributes to the global study of acute care in the developing world and also
      provides a self-analysis identifying disease patterns of the area, training
      topics for residents, areas for introducing protocols, and information to help
      planning for rural EDs in low- and middle-income countries.

TI  - Evidence of suppression of onchocerciasis transmission in the Venezuelan
      Amazonian focus.
PG  - 40
LID - 10.1186/s13071-016-1313-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) has set goals for onchocerciasis 
      elimination in Latin America by 2015. Most of the six previously endemic
      countries are attaining this goal by implementing twice a year (and in some foci,
      quarterly) mass ivermectin (Mectizan(R)) distribution. Elimination of
      transmission has been verified in Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico. Challenges remain
      in the Amazonian focus straddling Venezuela and Brazil, where the disease affects
      the hard-to-reach Yanomami indigenous population. We provide evidence of
      suppression of Onchocerca volvulus transmission by Simulium guianense s.l. in 16 
      previously hyperendemic Yanomami communities in southern Venezuela after 15 years
      of 6-monthly and 5 years of 3-monthly mass ivermectin treatment. METHODS:
      Baseline and monitoring and evaluation parasitological, ophthalmological,
      entomological and serological surveys were conducted in selected sentinel and
      extra-sentinel communities of the focus throughout the implementation of the
      programme. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2012-2015, clinico-parasitological surveys
      indicate a substantial decrease in skin microfilarial prevalence and intensity of
      infection; accompanied by no evidence (or very low prevalence and intensity) of
      ocular microfilariae in the examined population. Of a total of 51,341 S.
      guianense flies tested by PCR none had L3 infection (heads only). Prevalence of
      infective flies and seasonal transmission potentials in 2012-2013 were,
      respectively, under 1% and 20 L3/person/transmission season. Serology in children
      aged 1-10 years demonstrated that although 26 out of 396 (7%) individuals still
      had Ov-16 antibodies, only 4/218 (2%) seropositives were aged 1-5 years.
      CONCLUSIONS: We report evidence of recent transmission and morbidity suppression 
      in some communities of the focus representing 75% of the Yanomami population and 
      70% of all known communities. We conclude that onchocerciasis transmission could 
      be feasibly interrupted in the Venezuelan Amazonian focus.

TI  - Whipworms in humans and pigs: origins and demography.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/s13071-016-1325-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trichuris suis and T. trichiura are two different whipworm species
      that infect pigs and humans, respectively. T. suis is found in pigs worldwide
      while T. trichiura is responsible for nearly 460 million infections in people,
      mainly in areas of poor sanitation in tropical and subtropical areas. The
      evolutionary relationship and the historical factors responsible for this
      worldwide distribution are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to
      reconstruct the demographic history of Trichuris in humans and pigs, the
      evolutionary origin of Trichuris in these hosts and factors responsible for
      parasite dispersal globally. METHODS: Parts of the mitochondrial nad1 and rrnL
      genes were sequenced followed by population genetic and phylogenetic analyses.
      Populations of Trichuris examined were recovered from humans (n = 31), pigs (n = 
      58) and non-human primates (n = 49) in different countries on different
      continents, namely Denmark, USA, Uganda, Ecuador, China and St. Kitts
      (Caribbean). Additional sequences available from GenBank were incorporated into
      the analyses. RESULTS: We found no differentiation between human-derived
      Trichuris in Uganda and the majority of the Trichuris samples from non-human
      primates suggesting a common African origin of the parasite, which then was
      transmitted to Asia and further to South America. On the other hand, there was no
      differentiation between pig-derived Trichuris from Europe and the New World
      suggesting dispersal relates to human activities by transporting pigs and their
      parasites through colonisation and trade. Evidence for recent pig transport from 
      China to Ecuador and from Europe to Uganda was also observed from their
      parasites. In contrast, there was high genetic differentiation between the pig
      Trichuris in Denmark and China in concordance with the host genetics.
      CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence for an African origin of T. trichiura which were
      then transmitted with human ancestors to Asia and further to South America. A
      host shift to pigs may have occurred in Asia from where T. suis seems to have
      been transmitted globally by a combination of natural host dispersal and
      anthropogenic factors.

PG  - 1556-68
LID - 10.1128/AEM.03299-15 [doi]
AB  - Xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited phytopathogenic bacterium endemic to the
      Americas that has recently emerged in Asia and Europe. Although this bacterium is
      classified as a quarantine organism in the European Union, importation of plant
      material from contaminated areas and latent infection in asymptomatic plants have
      engendered its inevitable introduction. In 2012, four coffee plants (Coffea
      arabica and Coffea canephora) with leaf scorch symptoms growing in a confined
      greenhouse were detected and intercepted in France. After identification of the
      causal agent, this outbreak was eradicated. Three X. fastidiosa strains were
      isolated from these plants, confirming a preliminary identification based on
      immunology. The strains were characterized by multiplex PCR and by multilocus
      sequence analysis/typing (MLSA-MLST) based on seven housekeeping genes. One
      strain, CFBP 8073, isolated from C. canephora imported from Mexico, was assigned 
      to X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa/X. fastidiosa subsp. sandyi. This strain
      harbors a novel sequence type (ST) with novel alleles at two loci. The two other 
      strains, CFBP 8072 and CFBP 8074, isolated from Coffea arabica imported from
      Ecuador, were allocated to X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca. These two strains shared a
      novel ST with novel alleles at two loci. These MLST profiles showed evidence of
      recombination events. We provide genome sequences for CFBP 8072 and CFBP 8073
      strains. Comparative genomic analyses of these two genome sequences with publicly
      available X. fastidiosa genomes, including the Italian strain CoDiRO, confirmed
      these phylogenetic positions and provided candidate alleles for coffee plant
      adaptation. This study demonstrates the global diversity of X. fastidiosa and
      highlights the diversity of strains isolated from coffee plants.

TI  - Prevalence, Genetic Characterization, and 18S Small Subunit Ribosomal RNA
      Diversity of Trypanosoma rangeli in Triatomine and Mammal Hosts in Endemic Areas 
      for Chagas Disease in Ecuador.
PG  - 732-42
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2015.1794 [doi]
AB  - Trypanosoma rangeli is a nonpathogenic parasite for humans; however, its medical 
      importance relies in its similarity and overlapping distribution with Trypanosoma
      cruzi, causal agent of Chagas disease in the Americas. The genetic diversity of
      T. rangeli and its association with host species (triatomines and mammals) has
      been identified along Central and the South America; however, it has not included
      data of isolates from Ecuador. This study reports infection with T. rangeli in 18
      genera of mammal hosts and five species of triatomines in three environments
      (domestic, peridomestic, and sylvatic). Higher infection rates were found in the 
      sylvatic environment, in close association with Rhodnius ecuadoriensis. The
      results of this study extend the range of hosts infected with this parasite and
      the geographic range of the T. rangeli genotype KP1(-)/lineage C in South
      America. It was not possible to detect variation on T. rangeli from the central
      coastal region and southern Ecuador with the analysis of the small subunit
      ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) gene, even though these areas are ecologically different
      and a phenotypic subdivision of R. ecuadoriensis has been found. R. ecuadoriensis
      is considered one of the most important vectors for Chagas disease transmission
      in Ecuador due to its wide distribution and adaptability to diverse environments.
      An extensive knowledge of the trypanosomes circulating in this species of
      triatomine, and associated mammal hosts, is important for delineating
      transmission dynamics and preventive measures in the endemic areas of Ecuador and
      Northern Peru.

      Chagas Disease in Southern Ecuador.
PG  - e0004142
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chagas disease is endemic to the southern Andean region of Ecuador,
      an area with one of the highest poverty rates in the country. However, few
      studies have looked into the epidemiology, vectors and transmission risks in this
      region. In this study we describe the triatomine household infestation in Loja
      province, determine the rate of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in triatomines and
      study the risk factors associated with infestation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS: An entomological survey found four triatomine species (Rhodnius
      ecuadoriensis, Triatoma carrioni, Panstrongylus chinai, and P. rufotuberculatus) 
      infesting domiciles in 68% of the 92 rural communities examined. Nine percent of 
      domiciles were infested, and nymphs were observed in 80% of the infested
      domiciles. Triatomines were found in all ecological regions below 2,200 masl. We 
      found R. ecuadoriensis (275 to 1948 masl) and T. carrioni (831 to 2242 masl)
      mostly in bedrooms within the domicile, and they were abundant in chicken coops
      near the domicile. Established colonies of P. chinai (175 to 2003 masl) and P.
      rufotuberculatus (404 to 1613 masl) also were found in the domicile. Triatomine
      infestation was associated with surrogate poverty indicators, such as poor
      sanitary infrastructure (lack of latrine/toilet [w = 0.95], sewage to environment
      [w = 1.0]). Vegetation type was a determinant of infestation [w = 1.0] and vector
      control program insecticide spraying was a protective factor [w = 1.0]. Of the
      754 triatomines analyzed, 11% were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and 2% were
      infected with T. rangeli. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To date, only limited vector 
      control efforts have been implemented. Together with recent reports of widespread
      sylvatic triatomine infestation and frequent post-intervention reinfestation,
      these results show that an estimated 100,000 people living in rural areas of
      southern Ecuador are at high risk for T. cruzi infection. Therefore, there is a
      need for a systematic, sustained, and monitored vector control intervention that 
      is coupled with improvement of socio-economic conditions.

TI  - The association of sleep-disordered breathing with high cerebral pulsatility
      might not be related to diffuse small vessel disease. A pilot study.
PG  - 500

AB  - BACKGROUND: In a population-based sampling study conducted in community-dwelling 
      older adults living in rural Ecuador, we aimed to assess the relation among
      sleep-disordered breathing, cerebral pulsatility index, and diffuse small vessel 
      disease. METHODS: Of 25 participants, 9 (36%) had moderate-to-severe
      sleep-disordered breathing, characterized by an apnea/hypopnea index >/=15 per
      hour, and 10 (40%) had moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensities, graded
      according to the modified Fazekas scale. Mean (SD) pulsatility index in the
      middle cerebral artery was 1.18 (0.19) and positively correlated with the
      apnea/hypopnea index (R = .445, P = .03, [Pearson's correlation coefficient]).
      The middle cerebral artery pulsatility index was increased in persons with
      moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered breathing compared with persons who had
      none-to-mild sleep-disordered breathing (mean [SD] 1.11 [0.12] vs. 1.3 [0.23], P 
      = .01). No significant differences were found in the prevalence of
      moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensities across groups of
      sleep-disordered breathing (P = .40) or in the mean apnea/hypopnea index across
      groups of persons with none-to-mild or moderate-to-severe white matter
      hyperintensities (P = .16). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that
      moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered breathing correlates with cerebral
      pulsatility, but such association might be independent of diffuse small vessel
      disease.

TI  - Rhizobium ecuadorense sp. nov., an indigenous N2-fixing symbiont of the
      Ecuadorian common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) genetic pool.
PG  - 3162-3169
LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.000392 [doi]
AB  - There are two major centres of genetic diversification of common bean (Phaseolus 
      vilgaris L.), the Mesoamerican and the Andean, and the legume is capable of
      establishing nitrogen-fixing symbioses with several rhizobia; Rhizobium etli
      seems to be the dominant species in both centres. Another genetic pool of common 
      bean, in Peru and Ecuador, is receiving increasing attention, and studies of
      microsymbionts from the region can help to increase our knowledge about
      coevolution of this symbiosis. We have previously reported several putative new
      lineages from this region and here present data indicating that strains belonging
      to one of them, PEL4, represent a novel species. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence 
      phylogeny, PEL4 strains are positioned in the Rhizobium phaseoli/R.
      etli/Rhizobium leguminosarum clade, but show unique properties in several
      morphological, physiological and biochemical analyses, as well as in BOX-PCR
      profiles ( < 75% similarity with related species). PEL4 strains also differed
      from related species based on multilocus sequence analysis of three housekeeping 
      genes (glnII, gyrB and recA). Nucleotide identities of the three concatenated
      genes between PEL4 strains and related species ranged from 91.8 to 94.2%, being
      highest with Rhizobium fabae. DNA-DNA hybridization ( < 47% DNA relatedness) and 
      average nucleotide identity values of the whole genomes ( < 90.2%) also supported
      the novel species status. The PEL4 strains were effective in nodulating and
      fixing N2 with common beans. The data supported the view that PEL4 strains
      represent a novel species, Rhizobium ecuadorense sp. nov. The type strain is
      CNPSo 671(T) ( = UMR 1450(T) = PIMAMPIRS I 5(T) = LMG 27578(T)).

AB  - Chagas disease is the most important parasitic disease in Latin America. The
      causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, displays high genetic diversity and
      circulates in complex transmission cycles among domestic, peridomestic and
      sylvatic environments. In Ecuador, Rhodnius ecuadoriensis is known to be the
      major vector species implicated in T. cruzi transmission. However, across vast
      areas of Ecuador, little is known about T. cruzi genetic diversity in relation to
      different parasite transmission scenarios. Fifty-eight T. cruzi stocks from the
      central Ecuadorian coast, most of them derived from R. ecuadoriensis, were
      included in the study. All of them were genotyped as T. cruzi discrete typing
      unit I (DTU TcI). Analysis of 23 polymorphic microsatellite loci through neighbor
      joining and discriminant analysis of principal components yielded broadly
      congruent results and indicate genetic subdivision between sylvatic and
      peridomestic transmission cycles. However, both analyses also suggest that any
      barriers are imperfect and significant gene flow between parasite subpopulations 
      in different habitats exists. Also consistent with moderate partition and
      residual gene flow between subpopulations, the fixation index (FST) was
      significant, but of low magnitude. Finally, the lack of private alleles in the
      domestic/peridomestic transmission cycle suggests the sylvatic strains constitute
      the ancestral population. The T. cruzi population in the central Ecuadorian coast
      shows moderate tendency to subdivision according to transmission cycle. However, 
      connectivity between cycles exists and the sylvatic T. cruzi population harbored 
      by R. ecuadoriensis vectors appears to constitute a source from which the
      parasite invades human domiciles and their surroundings in this region. We
      discuss the implications these findings have for the planning, implementation and
      evaluation of local Chagas disease control interventions.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) content in cacao beans above a critical level (0.6 mg kg(-1)) has
      raised concerns in the consumption of cacao-based chocolate. Little is available 
      regarding Cd concentration in soil and cacao in Ecuador. The aim of this study
      was to determine the status of Cd in both, soils and cacao plants, in southern
      Ecuador. Soil samples were collected from 19 farms at 0-5, 5-15, 15-30, and 30-50
      cm depths, whereas plant samples were taken from four nearby trees. Total
      recoverable and extractable Cd were measured at the different soil depths. Total 
      recoverable Cd ranged from 0.88 to 2.45 and 0.06 to 2.59, averaged 1.54 and 0.85 
      mg kg(-1), respectively in the surface and subsurface soils whereas the
      corresponding values for M3-extractable Cd were 0.08 to 1.27 and 0.02 to 0.33
      with mean values of 0.40 and 0.10 mg kg(-1). Surface soil in all sampling sites
      had total recoverable Cd above the USEPA critical level for agricultural soils
      (0.43 mg kg(-1)), indicating that Cd pollution occurs. Since both total
      recoverable and M3-extractable Cd significantly decreased depth wise,
      anthropogenic activities are more likely the source of contamination. Cadmium in 
      cacao tissues decreased in the order of beans>shell>>leaves. Cadmium content in
      cacao beans ranged from 0.02 to 3.00, averaged 0.94 mg kg(-1), and 12 out of 19
      sites had bean Cd content above the critical level. Bean Cd concentration was
      highly correlated with M3- or HCl-extractable Cd at both the 0-5 and 5-15 cm
      depths (r=0.80 and 0.82 for M3, and r=0.78 and 0.82 for HCl; P<0.01). These
      results indicate that accumulation of Cd in surface layers results in excessive
      Cd in cacao beans and M3- or HCl-extractable Cd are suitable methods for
      predicting available Cd in the studied soils.

TI  - Population-Based Study of Cerebral Microbleeds in Stroke-Free Older Adults Living
      in Rural Ecuador: The Atahualpa Project.
PG  - 1984-6
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.009594 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prevalence of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) in white and
      Asian populations range from 4% to 15%. However, there is no information from
      indigenous Latin American people. We aimed to assess prevalence and
      cerebrovascular correlates of CMB in stroke-free older adults living in rural
      Ecuador. METHODS: Of 311 Atahualpa residents aged >/=60 years identified during a
      door-to-door survey, 258 (83%) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging.
      Twenty-one were further excluded for a diagnosis of overt stroke. Using
      multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for demographics and
      cardiovascular risk factors, we evaluated whether CMB were independently
      associated with silent strokes, white matter hyperintensities, and global
      cortical atrophy. RESULTS: Twenty-six (11%) of 237 participants had CMB, which
      were single in 54% of cases. CMB were deep in 11 patients, cortical in 9, and
      located both deep and cortical in 6. In univariate analyses, CMB were associated 
      with age, systolic blood pressure, moderate-to-severe white matter
      hyperintensities, silent lacunar infarcts, and cortical atrophy. Mean (+/-SD)
      values for systolic blood pressure were 155+/-27 mm Hg in patients who had CMB
      versus 142+/-26 mm Hg in those who did not (P=0.017). In the adjusted models,
      moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensities (P=0.009), silent lacunar
      infarcts (P=0.003), and global cortical atrophy (P=0.04) were independently
      associated with CMB. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of CMB in stroke-free older adults
      living in Atahualpa is comparable with those reported from other ethnic groups.
      There is a strong relationship between CMB and increased age, high systolic blood
      pressure, silent markers of cerebral small vessel disease, and cortical atrophy.

TI  - GH Receptor Deficiency in Ecuadorian Adults Is Associated With Obesity and
      Enhanced Insulin Sensitivity.
PG  - 2589-96
LID - 10.1210/jc.2015-1678 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Ecuadorian subjects with GH receptor deficiency (GHRD) have not
      developed diabetes, despite obesity. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the
      metabolic associations for this phenomenon. DESIGN: Four studies were carried
      out: 1) glucose, lipid, adipocytokine concentrations; 2) metabolomics evaluation;
      3) metabolic responses to a high-calorie meal; and 4) oral glucose tolerance
      tests. SETTING: Clinical Research Institute in Quito, Ecuador. SUBJECTS: Adults
      homozygous for the E180 splice mutation of the GH receptor (GHRD) were matched
      for age, gender, and body mass index with unaffected control relatives (C) as
      follows: study 1, 27 GHRD and 35 C; study 2, 10 GHRD and 10 C; study 3, seven
      GHRD and 11 C; and study 4, seven GHRD and seven C. RESULTS: Although GHRD
      subjects had greater mean percentage body fat than controls, their fasting
      insulin, 2-hour blood glucose, and triglyceride levels were lower. The indicator 
      of insulin sensitivity, homeostasis model of assessment 2%S, was greater (P <
      .0001), and the indicator of insulin resistance, homeostasis model of assessment 
      2-IR, was lower (P = .0025). Metabolomic differences between GHRD and control
      subjects were consistent with their differing insulin sensitivity, including
      postprandial decreases of branched-chain amino acids that were more pronounced in
      controls. High molecular weight and total adiponectin concentrations were greater
      in GHRD (P = .0004 and P = .0128, respectively), and leptin levels were lower (P 
      = .02). Although approximately 65% the weight of controls, GHRD subjects consumed
      an identical high-calorie meal; nonetheless, their mean glucose concentrations
      were lower, with mean insulin levels one-third those of controls. Results of the 
      2-hour oral glucose tolerance test were similar. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures 
      of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokines, and energy metabolites. CONCLUSIONS:
      Without GH counter-regulation, GHRD is associated with insulin efficiency and
      obesity. Lower leptin levels, despite higher percentage body fat, suggest that
      obesity-associated leptin resistance is GH dependent. Elevated adiponectin levels
      not correlated with percentage body fat indicate that GH signaling is necessary
      for their typical suppression with obesity.

TI  - Systematics of the endangered toad genus Andinophryne (Anura: Bufonidae):
      phylogenetic position and synonymy under the genus Rhaebo.
PG  - 347-66
LID - 10.11646/zootaxa.3947.3.3 [doi]
AB  - Bufonidae is one of the most diverse amphibian families. Its large-scale
      phylogenetic relationships are relatively well understood with the exception of
      few Neotropical genera that may have diverged early in the evolution of the
      family. One of those genera is Andinophryne, a poorly known group of three toad
      species distributed in the western slopes of the Andes of northern Ecuador and
      southern Colombia. Their phylogenetic position is unknown due to lack of genetic 
      data. We estimated a new phylogeny (over 200 species) of the family Bufonidae
      based on DNA sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear genes to assess the
      phylogenetic position of Andinophryne based on recently collected specimens of A.
      colomai and A. olallai from Ecuador and Colombia. We also examined external and
      internal morphology of Andinophryne to explore its congruence with the new
      phylogeny. The mtDNA and nuclear phylogenies show that Andinophryne is embedded
      within Rhaebo, a genus that belongs to a large clade characterized by the
      presence parotoid glands. Morphological characters confirmed the affinity of
      Andinophryne to Rhaebo and a close relationship between Andinophryne colomai and 
      Andinophryne olallai. Rhaebo was paraphyletic relative to Andinophryne and to
      solve this problem we synonymize Andinophryne under Rhaebo. We discuss putative
      morphological synapomorphies for Rhaebo including Andinophryne. We provide
      species accounts for R. atelopoides new comb., R. colomai new comb. and R.
      olallai new comb. including assessments of their conservation status. We suggest 
      that the three species are Critically Endangered. Their altitudinal distribution 
      and association with streams are characteristic of endangered Andean amphibians.

TI  - New substitute name for the genus Napo Shaw, 2012 (Hymenoptera: Braconidae:
      Euphorinae).
PG  - 149
LID - 10.11646/zootaxa.3946.1.10 [doi]
AB  - The braconid genus Napo was established by Shaw (2012) for a single species Napo 
      townsendi Shaw, 2012 from Napo Province, Ecuador. However, the genus name Napo is
      preoccupied and was initially introduced by Linnavuori & DeLong (1976) for a
      deltocephalinae leafhopper genus with Napo brazosellus Linnavuori & DeLong, 1976 
      as the type species (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae). Thus, the genus Napo Shaw, 2012 is
      a junior homonym of the genus Napo Linnavuori & DeLong, 1976. According to
      Article 60 of the ICZN (2015), we propose the new replacement name Yanayacu nom. 
      nov. for Napo Shaw, 2012. The resulting nomenclatural changes are summarized
      below.

TI  - A phytochemical-rich diet may explain the absence of age-related decline in
      visual acuity of Amazonian hunter-gatherers in Ecuador.

AB  - Myopia is absent in undisturbed hunter-gatherers but ubiquitous in modern
      populations. The link between dietary phytochemicals and eye health is well
      established, although transition away from a wild diet has reduced phytochemical 
      variety. We hypothesized that when larger quantities and greater variety of wild,
      seasonal phytochemicals are consumed in a food system, there will be a reduced
      prevalence of degenerative-based eye disease as measured by visual acuity. We
      compared food systems and visual acuity across isolated Amazonian Kawymeno
      Waorani hunter-gatherers and neighboring Kichwa subsistence agrarians, using
      dietary surveys, dietary pattern observation, and Snellen Illiterate E visual
      acuity examinations. Hunter-gatherers consumed more food species (130 vs. 63) and
      more wild plants (80 vs. 4) including 76 wild fruits, thereby obtaining larger
      variety and quantity of phytochemicals than agrarians. Visual acuity was
      inversely related to age only in agrarians (r = -.846, P < .001). As
      hypothesized, when stratified by age (<40 and >/= 40 years), Mann-Whitney U tests
      revealed that hunter-gatherers maintained high visual acuity throughout life,
      whereas agrarian visual acuity declined (P values < .001); visual acuity of
      younger participants was high across the board, however, did not differ between
      groups (P > .05). This unusual absence of juvenile-onset vision problems may be
      related to local, organic, whole food diets of subsistence food systems isolated 
      from modern food production. Our results suggest that intake of a wider variety
      of plant foods supplying necessary phytochemicals for eye health may help
      maintain visual acuity and prevent degenerative eye conditions as humans age.

TI  - Investigation of tick-borne bacteria (Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia 
      spp. and Borrelia spp.) in ticks collected from Andean tapirs, cattle and
      vegetation from a protected area in Ecuador.
PG  - 46

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ixodid ticks play an important role in the transmission and ecology
      of infectious diseases. Information about the circulation of tick-borne bacteria 
      in ticks is lacking in Ecuador. Our aims were to investigate the tick species
      that parasitize Andean tapirs and cattle, and those present in the vegetation
      from the buffer zone of the Antisana Ecological Reserve and Cayambe-Coca National
      Park (Ecuador), and to investigate the presence of tick-borne bacteria. METHODS: 
      Tick species were identified based on morphologic and genetic criteria. Detection
      of tick-borne bacteria belonging to Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Borrelia
      genera was performed by PCRs. RESULTS: Our ticks included 91 Amblyomma
      multipunctum, 4 Amblyomma spp., 60 Rhipicephalus microplus, 5 Ixodes spp. and 1
      Ixodes boliviensis. A potential Candidatus Rickettsia species closest to
      Rickettsia monacensis and Rickettsia tamurae (designated Rickettsia sp. 12G1) was
      detected in 3 R. microplus (3/57, 5.3%). In addition, Anaplasma spp., assigned at
      least to Anaplasma phagocytophilum (or closely related genotypes) and Anaplasma
      marginale, were found in 2 A. multipunctum (2/87, 2.3%) and 13 R. microplus
      (13/57, 22.8%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of Rickettsia sp. in
      ticks from Ecuador, and the analyses of sequences suggest the presence of a
      potential novel Rickettsia species. Ecuadorian ticks from Andear tapirs, cattle
      and vegetation belonging to Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera were infected with
      Anaplasmataceae. Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato were not
      found in any ticks.

PG  - 126-33
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/tru209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This project investigates the effectiveness and feasibility of
      scaling-up an eco-bio-social approach for implementing an integrated
      community-based approach for dengue prevention in comparison with existing
      insecticide-based and emerging biolarvicide-based programs in an endemic setting 
      in Machala, Ecuador. METHODS: An integrated intervention strategy (IIS) for
      dengue prevention (an elementary school-based dengue education program, and clean
      patio and safe container program) was implemented in 10 intervention clusters
      from November 2012 to November 2013 using a randomized controlled cluster trial
      design (20 clusters: 10 intervention, 10 control; 100 households per cluster with
      1986 total households). Current existing dengue prevention programs served as the
      control treatment in comparison clusters. Pupa per person index (PPI) is used as 
      the main outcome measure. Particular attention was paid to social mobilization
      and empowerment with IIS. RESULTS: Overall, IIS was successful in reducing PPI
      levels in intervention communities versus control clusters, with intervention
      clusters in the six paired clusters that followed the study design experiencing a
      greater reduction of PPI compared to controls (2.2 OR, 95% CI: 1.2 to 4.7).
      Analysis of individual cases demonstrates that consideration for contexualizing
      programs and strategies to local neighborhoods can be very effective in reducing 
      PPI for dengue transmission risk reduction. CONCLUSIONS: In the rapidly evolving 
      political climate for dengue control in Ecuador, integration of successful social
      mobilization and empowerment strategies with existing and emerging
      biolarvicide-based government dengue prevention and control programs is promising
      in reducing PPI and dengue transmission risk in southern coastal communities like
      Machala. However, more profound analysis of social determination of health is
      called for to assess sustainability prospects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fasciolosis is the disease transmitted by vectors with the highest 
      latitudinal, longitudinal, and altitudinal distribution due to the colonizing
      capacity of the parasite Fasciola hepatica and its intermediate hosts, Lymnaeidae
      mollusks. These snails are under research due to their epidemiological
      importance, but their taxonomic identification is difficult given their
      interspecific phenotypical similarity. For this reason, there is uncertainty
      regarding Lymnaea cousini -a host of F. hepatica in Colombia- due to the
      morphological similarity it has with Lymnaea meridensis , recently described for 
      Venezuela. OBJECTIVE: To confirm with the COI marker (ADNmt) the taxonomic status
      of individuals morphologically identified as L. cousini from Narino, Norte de
      Santander, and Santander (Colombia), deposited in the Vector Mollusks Collection 
      VHET No. 37 of Universidad de Antioquia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The amplification
      of the mitochondrial COI required total DNA extraction of each individual s foot 
      using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen(R)). Products amplified were sent
      for sequencing to Macrogen Inc., Korea. Twenty seven sequences generated in this 
      research were compared to sequences published in the GenBank, including sequences
      of the type locality of L. cousini . RESULTS: Two new haplotypes of L. cousini
      were obtained for Colombia. Specimens from Narino correspond to haplotype A,
      referenced for Ecuador, and specimens from Santander and Norte de Santander
      belong to a new haplotype we called haplotype D. CONCLUSION: By using the
      mitochondrial COI marker, we confirmed that the species under study did
      correspond to L. cousini . The number of known haplotypes of the species for
      Colombia has been duplicated and its geographical distribution has been extended 
      to the southwest and northeast of the Colombian high Andean region.

TI  - First Report of Verticillium Wilt Caused by Verticillium dahliae on Avocado Trees
      in Greece.

AB  - Avocado (Persea americana) is an important crop for Chania, Crete, Greece, and is
      grown on more than 800 ha. In November 2013, 4-year-old trees in a new avocado
      grove of cv. Hass grafted onto the rootstock 'Bacon,' previously planted in
      citrus trees, showed symptoms of yellowing, leaf fall, twig and branch dieback
      and vascular tissue discoloration. Disease incidence was estimated at 2.3% (12
      out of 530 trees affected). A fungus was consistently and readily isolated from
      symptomatic vascular tissue, previously surface-disinfested with 95% ethanol, on 
      acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA). After 7 days, slow-growing colonies were
      transferred to PDA and the growth rate of the fungus was 2.9 mm/day at 24 degrees
      C in the dark. Microscopic observations revealed hyaline hyphae with many
      irregular, dark microsclerotia measuring 40 to 200 x 30 to 75 mum (average 94.5 x
      50.3 mum) developing after 21 days of growth. Hyaline, elliptical, single-celled 
      conidia measuring 2.8 to 7.5 x 2.5 to 4.3 mum (average 4.8 x 3.1 mum) developed
      on verticillate conidiophores. For molecular characterization, Verticillium
      dahliae specific primer pair ITS1-F/ITS2-R that amplifies the rRNA internal
      transcribed spacer (ITS) region was used (2). Band of expected size was
      amplified, sequenced, and deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KJ818294). On the
      basis of morphological characteristics (3) and a BLAST search with 100% identity 
      to the published ITS sequence of a V. dahliae isolate in GenBank (KC834733.1),
      the fungus was identified as V. dahliae. Five 1-year-old avocado plants of cv.
      Hass, grafted onto the rootstock 'Bacon,' were used for pathogenicity tests.
      Artificial inoculation was performed by making a 5.0 x 3.5 mm hole in the
      rootstock trunk, injecting approximately 40 mul of a 2.8 x 10(7) conidia/ml
      suspension into the vessels (spores were introduced passively), sealing with
      Vaseline, and covering with adhesive paper tape. Five control plants were mock
      inoculated with sterilized distilled water. Disease symptoms that appeared 18
      days post artificial inoculation were similar to those observed under natural
      infection conditions. Thirty-five days post artificial inoculation, disease
      incidence was 80%, whereas the percentage of positive V. dahliae re-isolations
      from infected tissues was 95% (96.7 and 93.3% from rootstock and graft,
      respectively). The extent of vascular tissue discoloration from the point of
      inoculation ranged from 11 to 62 cm, whereas V. dahliae was successfully
      re-isolated even from the end of the graft (approximately 60 cm above the initial
      inoculation point), thus confirming Koch's postulates. Neither symptoms nor
      positive isolations were observed in control plants. The pathogenicity test was
      repeated twice with similar results. Verticillium wilt of avocado has been
      observed in several countries including Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Israel,
      Mexico, Morocco, Spain, and the United States (1). To the best of our knowledge, 
      this is the first report of Verticillium wilt on avocado in Greece. This disease 
      could potentially be an increasing problem in areas where young avocado trees are
      established on land previously planted in vegetable crops. References: (1) J. C.

TI  - 'Candidatus Rickettsia asemboensis' and Wolbachia spp. in Ctenocephalides felis
      and Pulex irritans fleas removed from dogs in Ecuador.
PG  - 455
LID - 10.1186/s13071-014-0455-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flea-borne infections are distributed worldwide. Up to date there are
      no reports about microorganisms associated to fleas in Ecuador. METHODS:
      Seventy-one Pulex irritans and 8 Ctenocephalides felis fleas were removed from
      dogs in two Ecuadorian areas (Pastaza and Chimborazo Provinces) in December 2012.
      DNA extracts were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting
      universal 16S rRNA, as well as screened for the presence of Rickettsia spp.
      (gltA, htrA, ompB, sca4 and ompA genes) and Bartonella spp. (rpoB, gltA and ITS
      genes). RESULTS: Our results showed the presence of 'Candidatus Rickettsia
      asemboensis' (highly similar to R. felis) in C. felis and Wolbachia spp.
      endosimbionts in P. irritans collected from animals in Ecuador. No fleas were
      found to be positive for any Bartonella species or Yersinia pestis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Clinicians should be aware of the potential risk of this new Candidatus
      Rickettsia sp. and keep in mind other flea-borne infections since these flea
      species frequently bite humans.

TI  - A review of Northern Peruvian glassfrogs (Centrolenidae), with the description of
      four new remarkable species.
PG  - 1-87
LID - 10.11646/zootaxa.3851.1.1 [doi]
AB  - Peru is well known for amphibian diversity and endemism, yet there have been
      relatively few field studies of glassfrog (Centrolenidae) diversity in this
      country. Research in Colombia and Ecuador indicates that centrolenid diversity is
      higher in the northern Andes. However, part of this trend appears to be due to
      sampling effort. We conducted fieldwork throughout northern Peru, and based on
      phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, combined with bioacoustic and
      morphological analyses of new and available material we now recognize 33 species 
      from the country (versus 30 species prior to this work). Field surveys led to the
      discovery of four remarkable species: Centrolene charapita new species is a
      large, ornamented glassfrog that appears to be sister to Ce. geckoideum;
      Chimerella corleone new species represents the second-known member of the genus
      Chimerella; Cochranella guayasamini new species is the second-known member of the
      genus with humeral spines; and Hyalinobatrachium anachoretus new species occurs
      in the cloud forest of the east-Andean versant in Peru. In addition to the new
      species described here, we provide new country records, new localities including 
      range extensions of up to 875 km, information on diagnostic characters and
      phylogenetic relationships, call and larval descriptions, and observations on
      natural history for several Peruvian centrolenids. Our results also revealed
      several taxonomic problems concerning species of the genus Rulyrana, and we
      conclude that R. croceopodes and R. tangarana are junior synonyms of R.
      saxiscandens. By implication of our phylogenetic analyses, we recognize the
      following new combinations: Espadarana audax new combination, Espadarana
      durrelorum new combination, and Espadarana fernandoi new combination.

TI  - Are recent graduates enough prepared to perform obstetric skills in their rural
      and compulsory year? A study from Ecuador.
PG  - e005759
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005759 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the possible mismatch of
      obstetrical skills between the training offered in Ecuadorian medical schools and
      the tasks required for compulsory rural service. SETTING: Primary care, rural
      health centres in Southern Ecuador. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 92 recent graduated 
      medical doctors during their compulsory rural year. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY
      OUTCOMES MEASURES: A web-based survey was developed with 21 obstetrical skills.
      The questionnaire was sent to all rural doctors who work in Loja province,
      Southern Ecuador, at the Ministry of Health (n=92). WE MEASURED TWO CATEGORIES:
      'importance of skills in rural practice' with a five-point Likert-type scale (1= 
      strongly disagree; 5= strongly agree); and 'clerkship experience' using a nominal
      scale divided in five levels: level 1 (not seen, not performed) to level 5
      (performed 10 times or more). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) was
      used to observe associations. RESULTS: A negative correlation was found in the
      skills: 'episiotomy and repair', 'umbilical vein catheterisation', 'speculum
      examination', 'evaluation of cervical dilation during active labour', 'neonatal
      resuscitation' and 'vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery'. For instance 'Episiotomy
      and repair' is important (strongly agree and agree) to 100% of respondents, but
      in practice, only 38.9% of rural doctors performed the task three times and 8.3% 
      only once during the internship, similar pattern is seen in the others.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study we have noted the gap between the medical needs of
      populations in rural areas and training provided during the clerkship experiences
      of physicians during their rural service year. It is imperative to ensure that
      rural doctors are appropriately trained and skilled in the performance of routine
      obstetrical duties. This will help to decrease perinatal morbidity and mortality 
      in rural Ecuador.

TI  - First Report of Burkholderia glumae Causing Bacterial Panicle Blight on Rice in
      Ecuador.

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the leading crops and the basis of most diets in
      Ecuador and other countries. Diseases such as bacterial panicle blight (BPB),
      also known as seedling rot or grain rot, have the potential to threaten rice
      production worldwide. Burkholderia glumae, a causal agent of BPB, has severely
      affected the rice industry in many countries of Africa, Asia, and the Americas
      (1,2,4), but no report of this bacteria in Ecuador can be found in the
      literature. Rice plantations showing BPB-like symptoms including upright panicles
      with stained and vain grains were spotted in Palestina city, one of Ecuador's
      most extensive rice areas, in July 2013, but similar symptoms have been observed 
      in the region since early 2012. Six symptomatic plants from two different groves 
      were collected. Samples were plated on the semi-selective medium S-PG (KH2PO4 1.3
      g, Na2HPO4 1.2 g, (NH4)2SO4 5 g, MgSO4.7H2O 0.25 g, Na2MoO4.2H2O 24 mg, EDTA-Fe
      10 mg, L-cystine 10 mug, D-sorbitol 10 g, pheneticillin potassium 50 mg,
      ampicillin sodium 10 mg, cetrimide 10 mg, methyl violet 1 mg, phenol red 20 mg,
      agar 15 g/liter distilled water) and axenic colonies were transferred to potato
      dextrose agar (PDA) to test for fluorescence (3). Colonies of the potential
      pathogen were 1 mm, circular, entire margin, with a smooth and shiny surface.
      When cultured in PDA, isolates showed a moist texture, dull yellow color, and
      displayed fluorescence with exposure to UV light. Cells were bacterial
      gram-negative rods of 1 to 2 x 0.5 mum. Twelve presumptive isolates were
      submitted to biochemical tests (API 20NE). The biochemical profile (APIWEB)
      showed that all the isolates belonged to the Burkholderia genus with a 99.9%
      similarity. To determine the bacterial species, colonies were submitted to ELISA 
      tests using specific antibodies for B. glumae from Agdia, Inc. The two isolates
      that were positive for B. glumae were sequenced using a part of the 16s rDNA
      amplified by the primers 536F: 5'-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAATAC-3' and 1492R:
      5'-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3'. The obtained sequences (deposited into GenBank as
      KF601202) shared 100% similarity with several B. glumae strains after a BLAST
      query. Isolates were then diluted to 10(8) UFC/ml and used to inoculate healthy
      rice plants. Inoculated plants produced BPB-like symptoms including upright
      panicles with stained vain grains and the bacterium was re-isolated from
      symptomatic plants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of B. 
      glumae in Ecuador. Further research is ongoing to identify and determine the
      pathogenicity of the remaining Burkholderia strains that tested negative for B.

TI  - Ecological factors predictive of wild spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth) foraging
      decisions in Yasuni, Ecuador.
PG  - 1185-95
LID - 10.1002/ajp.22303 [doi]
AB  - Because fruiting trees are uncommon in tropical forests, frugivorous primates
      experience selective pressure to incorporate knowledge of where to find feeding
      trees, what to expect when they arrive there, and when they can return after
      depleting a tree. I investigated these abilities in wild spider monkeys (Ateles
      belzebuth) in Yasuni, Ecuador, by analyzing the characteristics of feeding trees 
      that drive foraging decisions. Foraging data were derived from four 2-week
      follows of focal adult females, conducted between May and December 1999, during
      which I measured and mapped all trees in which the focal subject fed, feeding
      bout duration, and the number of conspecifics feeding simultaneously with the
      focal. Taking into account the order in which feeding trees were visited across
      each follow, I analyzed each foraging decision from the second week of a follow, 
      treating all previously visited trees as options for visits. I scored each option
      tree in terms of nine ecological variables, including the distance from the
      decision to each location tree, DBH, recent feeding time and mean feeding times
      for the focal and other monkeys present, and the interval in hours between the
      foraging decision and the most recent visit to each option tree. I then examined 
      the predictive strength of the model using logistic regression analysis,
      comparing characteristics of selected trees to those not selected. The overall
      model successfully predicted trees selected by focal monkeys (r(2) = 0.27).
      Monkeys preferentially moved to nearby, large canopy trees, in which previous
      feeding success was high, and which were visited after an interval of 3.5 days.
      Interval mattered most for medium and large trees, but did not predict selection 
      for trees <10 cm DBH. Despite the large home range and large numbers of trees,
      Yasuni spider monkeys appeared to integrate spatial, value, and temporal
      information when deciding where to feed.

TI  - Preparing for rectal microbicides: sociocultural factors affecting product uptake
      among potential South American users.
PG  - e113-20
LID - 10.2105/AJPH.2013.301731 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined views on rectal microbicides (RMs), a potential HIV
      prevention option, among men who have sex with men and transgender women in 3
      South American cities. METHODS: During September 2009 to September 2010, we
      conducted 10 focus groups and 36 in-depth interviews (n = 140) in Lima and
      Iquitos, Peru, and Guayaquil, Ecuador, to examine 5 RM domains: knowledge,
      thoughts and opinions about RM as an HIV prevention tool, use, condoms, and
      social concerns. We coded emergent themes in recorded and transcribed data sets
      and extracted representative quotes. We collected sociodemographic information
      with a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: RM issues identified included
      limited knowledge; concerns regarding plausibility, side effects, and efficacy;
      impact on condom use; target users (insertive vs receptive partners); and access 
      concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the sociocultural issues affecting RMs is
      critical to their uptake and should be addressed prior to product launch.

AB  - Rhodnius barretti, a new triatomine species, is described based on adult
      specimens collected in rainforest environments within the Napo ecoregion of
      western Amazonia (Colombia and Ecuador). R. barretti resembles Rhodnius robustus 
      s.l., but mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences reveal that it is a strongly 
      divergent member of the "robustus lineage", i.e., basal to the clade encompassing
      Rhodnius nasutus, Rhodnius neglectus, Rhodnius prolixus and five members of the
      R. robustus species complex. Morphometric analyses also reveal consistent
      divergence from R. robustus s.l., including head and, as previously shown, wing
      shape and the length ratios of some anatomical structures. R. barretti occurs,
      often at high densities, in Attalea butyracea and Oenocarpus bataua palms. It is 
      strikingly aggressive and adults may invade houses flying from peridomestic
      palms. R. barretti must therefore be regarded as a potential Trypanosoma cruzi
      vector in the Napo ecoregion, where Chagas disease is endemic.

TI  - Zinc as an adjunct to the treatment of severe pneumonia in Ecuadorian children: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 497-505
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.113.067892 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of zinc as an adjunct to treatment of severe pneumonia in
      children have shown mixed results, possibly because of poor information on zinc
      status and respiratory pathogens. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of zinc
      given with standard antimicrobial treatment on the duration of respiratory signs 
      in children with severe pneumonia. Zinc status and pathogens were assessed.
      DESIGN: Children aged 2-59 mo with severe pneumonia who were admitted to the main
      children's hospital in Quito, Ecuador, were given standard antibiotics and
      randomly allocated to receive zinc supplements twice daily or a placebo.
      Measurements included anthropometric variables, breastfeeding, hemoglobin, plasma
      zinc, and common bacteria/viral respiratory pathogens. The primary outcome was
      time to resolution of respiratory signs. The secondary outcome was treatment
      failure. RESULTS: We enrolled 225 children in each group. There was no difference
      between groups in time to resolution of respiratory signs or treatment failure;
      pathogens were not associated with outcomes. Tachypnea and hypoxemia resolved
      faster in older children (P = 0.0001) than in younger ones. Higher basal zinc
      concentration (P = 0.011) and better height-for-age z score (HAZ) (P = 0.044)
      were associated with faster resolution of chest indrawing. Better
      weight-for-height z score (WHZ) (P = 0.031) and HAZ (P = 0.048) were associated
      with faster resolution of tachypnea. Increased C-reactive protein was associated 
      with a longer duration of tachypnea (P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Zinc did not affect
      time to pneumonia resolution or treatment failure, nor did type of respiratory
      pathogens affect outcomes. Higher basal zinc and better HAZ and WHZ were
      associated with reduced time to resolution of respiratory signs. These results
      suggest the need for prevention of chronic zinc deficiency and improvement of
      general nutritional status among Ecuadorian children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a resistance (R) surveillance program monitoring
      antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in Latin America (LATAM; Argentina [ARG],
      Brazil [BRA], Chile, Colombia [CBA], Costa Rica, Ecuador [ECU], Guatemala [GUA], 
      Mexico [MEX], Panama [PAN], Peru, and Venezuela [VEN]). METHODS: In 2011, 4979
      organisms were collected from 11 nations (20 laboratories) for susceptibility
      testing in a central laboratory design. Antimicrobials were tested by CLSI
      methods and results interpreted by CLSI and EUCAST breakpoints. Most common
      Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus [SA, 921], other staphylococci [CoNS; 299], 
      enterococci [218], Streptococcus pneumoniae [SPN; 182], beta-haemolytic
      streptococci [115]) and Gram-negative (E. coli [EC; 644], Klebsiella spp. [KSP;
      517], Enterobacters [272], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [PSA; 586], Acinetobacters
      [ACB; 494]) pathogens were analyzed against linezolid (LZD), vancomycin (VAN),
      tigecycline (TIG), colistin (COL), cefoperazone/sulbactam (C/S), and amikacin
      (AMK). RESULTS: MRSA rates varied from 29% (CBA, BRA) to 79% (Peru); but LZD
      (MIC90, 2mg/L), TIG (MIC90, 0.12mg/L) and VAN (MIC90, 1mg/L) covered all strains.
      Enterococci showed a 14% VRE rate, highest in BRA and MEX; all inhibited by TIG
      and daptomycin, but not LZD (three non-susceptible with G2576T mutations or cfr).
      Penicillin-R among SPN and viridans streptococci was 51.6 and 41.1%,
      respectively. LZD overall R against Gram-positives was 0.3%. High ESBL rates were
      observed in EC (54-71%) and KSP (>/=50%) from GUA, MEX and Peru, and six nations,
      respectively. Carbapenem-R in KSP was 9%, highest rates associated with KPC in
      BRA, CBA, ECU, PAN and VEN; also a NDM-1 in KSP from CBA. AMK, TIG, C/S and
      carbapenems were the broadest-spectrum agents tested against Enterobacteriaceae. 
      Only COL inhibited >90% of PSA; COL and TIG (</=2mg/L) covered >/=85% of ACB.
      CONCLUSIONS: LATAM nations demonstrated variable levels of antimicrobial R
      especially among Enterobacteriaceae (beta-lactamase-mediated), PSA and ACB. MRSA 
      (48%), VRE (14%) and multidrug-R SPN were also regional therapeutic challenges.

TI  - First Report of Raspberry bushy dwarf virus in Andean Blackberry (Rubus glaucus) 
      in Central Ecuador.
PG  - 1003
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-12-12-1198-PDN [doi]
AB  - During the past two decades, several viruses have been identified from Rubus spp.
      in wild and commercial plantings around the world (2). In Ecuador, approximately 
      14 tons of blackberries are produced each year from an estimated area of 5,500
      ha. In 2012, a preliminary survey was conducted to determine the presence of RNA 
      viruses in Rubus glaucus, the most prevalent blackberry in Ecuador. Fifteen
      plants showing leaf mottling and severe mosaic were leaf-sampled from each of
      five different fields in Azuay Province. A total of 12 pooled samples of 20 g
      were obtained from the collected symptomatic tissue and used for dsRNA extraction
      using a cellulose-based protocol for detection of RNA viruses in plants (3).
      Three dsRNA segments of approximately 5 kbp, 2 kbp, and 900 bp were observed from
      all 12 dsRNA preparations. The dsRNA was heat-denatured and used as template for 
      the generation of cDNA library using the universal random primer
      5'-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGAATTCNNNNNN-3', for reverse transcription (RT), and the anchor 
      primer 5'-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGAATTC-3'for PCR as described (1). The PCR products were 
      cloned using a StrataClone Kit (Agilent, CA) and sequenced (Macrogen, Korea).
      Sequence analysis revealed the presence of Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV), a 
      pollen-borne Idaeovirus naturally found in several Rubus spp. worldwide.
      Approximately 120 RBDV sequences obtained from the Ecuadorean isolate were
      assembled into two contigs belonging to RNA1 and RNA2. Both sequences were
      re-confirmed by RT-PCR using specific primers. Partial sequences were assigned
      GenBank Accessions KC315894, KC315893, and KC315892 for the replicase, MP and CP,
      respectively. Furthermore, BLAST searches showed that the nucleotide sequence
      corresponding to the replicase was 95% similar to an isolate from the resistance 
      breaking R15 strain (S51557.1), whereas the MP and CP nucleotide sequences were
      up to 98% similar to a Slovenian isolate (EU796088.1). Primers designed to
      amplify a 427-bp portion of the CP were used to detect RBDV from four blackberry 
      plantings in two distant production areas: Ambato in Tungurahua Province and
      Paute in Azuay Province. Leaf mottling and severe mosaic was observed in 90% of
      blackberry fields in those two locations. Leaf samples (n = 90) were randomly
      collected from both symptomatic and asymptomatic plants in each location. In
      Ambato, RBDV was detected in 50% and 40% of symptomatic and asymptomatic plants, 
      respectively. In Paute, RBDV was present in 70% of symptomatic plants and 29% of 
      asymptomatic plants. The presence of RBDV in asymptomatic plants suggests the
      virus might not be the sole causal agent of the disorder. Further studies are
      needed to determine the role of RBDV in the observed symptoms, since virus
      complexes responsible for increased severity of symptoms have been commonly
      reported in Rubus spp. (4). R. glaucus is native to the tropical highlands (from 
      Ecuador to Mexico) and differs from blackberries commercially grown in the United
      States and Europe. Therefore, RBDV-induced symptoms reported in blackberry grown 
      in the United States and Europe may not be extrapolated to the Andes berry. To
      the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of RBDV from blackberry in
      Ecuador. References: (1) P. Froussard. Nucleic Acids Res. 20:2900, 1992. (2) R.

AB  - The taxonomic affiliations of nineteen root-nodule bacteria isolated from the
      common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Mexico, Ecuador and Brazil were
      investigated by analyses of 16S rRNA and of four protein-coding housekeeping
      genes. One strain from Mexico could be assigned to Rhizobium etli and two from
      Brazil to Rhizobium leucaenae, whereas another from Mexico corresponded to a
      recently described bean-nodulating species-level lineage related to R. etli and
      Rhizobium phaseoli. Ten strains isolated in Ecuador and Mexico corresponded to
      three novel Rhizobium lineages that fall into the R. phaseoli/R. etli/Rhizobium
      leguminosarum clade. One of those lineages, with representatives isolated mostly 
      from Ecuador, seems to be dominant in beans from that Andean region. Only one of 
      the Mexican strains clustered within the Rhizobium tropici clade, but as an
      independent lineage. Interestingly, four strains were affiliated with species
      within the Rhizobium radiobacter clade. The existence of yet non-described native
      Rhizobium lineages in both the Andean and Mesoamerican areas is discussed in
      relation to common-bean diversity and environmental conditions.

TI  - Color, phenolics, and antioxidant activity of blackberry (Rubus glaucus Benth.), 
      blueberry (Vaccinium floribundum Kunth.), and apple wines from Ecuador.

AB  - Seventy wines were produced in Ecuador under different processing conditions with
      local fruits: Andean blackberries (Rubus glaucus Benth.) and blueberries
      (Vaccinium floribundum Kunth.) and Golden Reinette apples. Wines were evaluated
      for antioxidant activity (AA) using the radical scavenging capacity (DPPH)
      method, total phenolic content (TPC) using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, total
      monomeric anthocyanins (TMAs) using the pH differential test, and color
      parameters using VIS-spectrophotometry. For blackberry wines, ellagitannins and
      anthocyanins were also analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with
      diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD). Apples wines (n = 40) had the lowest TPC (608
      +/- 86 mg/L) and AA (2.1 +/- 0.3 mM Trolox). Blueberry wines (n = 12) had high
      TPC (1086 +/- 194 mg/L) and moderate AA (5.4 +/- 0.8 mM) but very low TMA (8 +/- 
      3 mg/L), with a color evolved toward yellow and blue shades. Blackberry wines (n 
      = 10) had the highest TPC (1265 +/- 91 mg/L) and AA (12 +/- 1 mM). Ellagitannins 
      were the major phenolics (1172 +/- 115 mg/L) and correlated well with AA (r =
      0.88). Within anthocyanins (TMA 73 +/- 16 mg/L), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (62%) and 
      cyanidin-3-glucoside (15%) were predominant. Wines obtained by cofermentation of 
      apples and blackberries (n = 8) showed intermediate characteristics (TPC 999 +/- 
      83 mg/L, AA 6.2 +/- 0.7 mM, TMA 35 +/- 22 mg/L) between the blackberry and
      blueberry wines. The results suggest that the Andean berries, particularly R.
      glaucus, are suitable raw materials to produce wines with an in vitro antioxidant
      capacity that is comparable to red grape wines.

AB  - To determine the extent of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and/or transmission in the
      southern Amazon region of Ecuador, three indigenous communities in the provinces 
      of Pastaza and Morona Santiago were serosurveyed. Chagatest(TM),
      Immunocomb((R))II and immunofluorescent (IF) assays were used. Among the 385
      inhabitants examined, nine (2.34%) were seropositive for T. cruzi infection. Of
      the nine positive sera, four (44.4%) fall in the 10-19, one each in the 20-29,
      30-39 and 40-49, and two in the 50-59 age groups. These results suggested the
      possible existence of an autochthonous active T. cruzi transmission in the region
      and provide the first serological evidence for T. cruzi infection in the southern
      province of Morona Santiago bordering Peru. Further studies are needed in these
      Amazonian provinces to ascertain the spread of T. cruzi infection in the area.

TI  - Time series analysis of onchocerciasis data from Mexico: a trend towards
      elimination.
PG  - e2033
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Latin America, there are 13 geographically isolated endemic foci
      distributed among Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Ecuador. The
      communities of the three endemic foci found within Mexico have been receiving
      ivermectin treatment since 1989. In this study, we predicted the trend of
      occurrence of cases in Mexico by applying time series analysis to monthly
      onchocerciasis data reported by the Mexican Secretariat of Health between 1988
      and 2011 using the software R. RESULTS: A total of 15,584 cases were reported in 
      Mexico from 1988 to 2011. The data of onchocerciasis cases are mainly from the
      main endemic foci of Chiapas and Oaxaca. The last case in Oaxaca was reported in 
      1998, but new cases were reported in the Chiapas foci up to 2011. Time series
      analysis performed for the foci in Mexico showed a decreasing trend of the
      disease over time. The best-fitted models with the smallest Akaike Information
      Criterion (AIC) were Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models,
      which were used to predict the tendency of onchocerciasis cases for two years
      ahead. According to the ARIMA models predictions, the cases in very low number
      (below 1) are expected for the disease between 2012 and 2013 in Chiapas, the last
      endemic region in Mexico. CONCLUSION: The endemic regions of Mexico evolved from 
      high onchocerciasis-endemic states to the interruption of transmission due to the
      strategies followed by the MSH, based on treatment with ivermectin. The extremely
      low level of expected cases as predicted by ARIMA models for the next two years
      suggest that the onchocerciasis is being eliminated in Mexico. To our knowledge, 
      it is the first study utilizing time series for predicting case dynamics of
      onchocerciasis, which could be used as a benchmark during monitoring and
      post-treatment surveillance.

TI  - Recommended IGF-I dosage causes greater fat accumulation and osseous maturation
      than lower dosage and may compromise long-term growth effects.
PG  - 839-45
LID - 10.1210/jc.2012-3704 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The maximum dose of IGF-I recommended for treatment of GH insensitivity 
      is commonly used. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test the hypothesis that a lower dose
      is as effective as a high dose of IGF-I in growth promotion and has fewer
      deleterious effects. DESIGN AND SETTING: Subjects were treated for 3 years with
      regular examinations including bone age and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and 
      for 1 year with abdominal ultrasound studies at a clinical research institute in 
      Quito, Ecuador. SUBJECTS: The study included 21 subjects ages 3.2-15.9 years with
      GH insensitivity due to the same splice site mutation on the GH receptor gene.
      INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were allocated to receive 120 (n = 14) or 80 (n = 7)
      mug/kg IGF-I twice daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Height velocity, osseous
      maturation, height SD scores (SDS), body composition, abdominal organ growth, and
      side effects were assessed. RESULTS: There were no differences in growth velocity
      or height SDS increment by dosage, and the SDS increase was greater than in other
      reported series. Osseous maturation over 3 years with the high dose was nearly
      twice as rapid as with the lower dose (P < .001) and correlated with an increase 
      in percentage body fat (r = .64; P < .001) and with adrenal size increase over 1 
      year (r = .32; P = .03). The ratio of bone age to height age was lower in the
      high-dose group after 3 years of treatment (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: The commonly 
      used IGF-I dosage of 120 mug/kg twice a day is excessive in comparison to a dose 
      of 80 mug/kg twice a day, disproportionately accelerating osseous maturation,
      probably from the combined effects of obesity and inappropriate adrenal growth,
      thus likely compromising adult height potential. Moreover, the lower dose
      decreases direct treatment cost by one-third.

AB  - UNLABELLED: In many studies the Body Mass Index (BMI) is associated with serum
      markers of inflammation such as CRP. In obesity there is an increase of adipose
      tissue resulting in an increase in BMI. It has been reported that adipose tissue 
      has a high production and secretion of a variety of proinflammatory molecules
      such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and C-reactive 
      protein, which may have local effects on the physiology of fat cell and systemic 
      effects on other organs. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of studies
      conducted in South America where they relate serum levels of CRP and
      anthropometric measurements, BMI and waist circumference (CC) in the healthy
      adult population. METHODS: We searched the PubMed database for articles published
      until January 2012, in English, Spanish and Portuguese, which relates serum
      levels of CRP and anthropometric measurements, BMI and WC. Search for words used 
      PCR, BMI and WC and the names of each of the South American countries (Argentina,
      Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname,
      Uruguay and Venezuela). RESULTS: We identified 141 potential studies, of which 8 
      met the inclusion criteria. In studies serum levels of CRP were positively
      correlated with BMI (r 0.08 to 0.84) and CC (r 0.27 to 1.03), being highly
      relevant correlation between BMI and CC with CRP serum levels observed in obese
      people in South America. CONCLUSION: Serum levels of CRP, and therefore
      subclinical inflammation seems to be related to increased rates of anthropometric
      measures in the South American population. A better understanding of the
      mechanisms and molecular components of the inflammatory response induced by an
      increase in BMI may lead to identifying new therapeutic targets that can prevent 
      the complications associated with obesity.

AB  - We used baseline data on 154 symptomatic neurocysticercosis (NCC) patients in
      Ecuador to identify predictors of the burden of cysts. We ran logistic regression
      models with the burden of cysts as the outcome, defined as the number of cysts in
      the brain (1 vs >1), and having cysts in all 3 phases of evolution (active,
      transitional and calcifications) vs <3. These two outcomes are thought to be
      indicators of exposure dose and/or repeated exposure over time. The predictors
      examined were: living in a rural area, living on a dirt road, living in an adobe 
      or wood house (vs brick/cement), no running water in the house, no bathroom in
      the house, having a domestic employee cook in the home, eating most meals at
      restaurants or street vendors, working in a manual labour job. We found that the 
      odds of having multiple NCC cysts was higher among those working in manual labour
      (OR=3.5, p=0.004), and those who ate most meals outside the home had higher odds 
      of having cysts in all 3 phases (OR=5.0, p=0.007). Burden of cysts may be a
      useful outcome when looking to identify exposure risk factors in the absence of
      an uninfected control group.

AB  - The global urban population is increasing rapidly, but patterns of urban
      expansion differ greatly among countries. Urban transition theory predicts that
      the shift from low to high urbanization depends on a country's history and level 
      of economic development. This study describes urban expansion in Colombia,
      Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia between 1992 and 2009. Urban dynamics were analyzed by
      combining nighttime lights and census data from 4032 municipalities. High-lit
      areas (>52-63 pixel values) were correlated with urban populations across
      municipalities and years (R (2) > 0.90). Analyses showed that between 1992 and
      2009 Bolivia and Ecuador had rapid population growth and rapidly increasing
      high-lit areas, while Peru and Colombia had lower rates of population growth and 
      urbanization (i.e., expansion of high-lit areas). We demonstrate how nighttime
      lights can be a useful tool, providing a homogeneous platform for multi-scale
      analyses of urban growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: C.E.R.A. is a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator with
      characteristics that permit a once-monthly schedule of administration for the
      maintenance treatment for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The main
      objective of this study was to assess the maintenance of Hb concentration with
      once-monthly intravenous and/or subcutaneous C.E.R.A. therapy in Latin American
      dialysis patients with chronic renal anemia previously treated with epoetin alfa 
      s.c or i.v 1-3 times per week. METHODS: This was a single-arm, open-label,
      multicenter, 32-week study of anemic patients with CKD previously treated with
      epoetin alfa sc or iv 1-3 times per week. After a 4-week screening period, during
      which mean Hb levels were maintained between 10.5 and 12.5 g/dL on their previous
      erythropoiesis stimulating agent, eligible patients entered a 16-week C.E.R.A.
      dose titration period followed by a 4-week efficacy evaluation period (EEP) and a
      28-week safety follow-up. The starting dose of C.E.R.A. was based on the previous
      dose of epoetin alfa. Doses of C.E.R.A. were then adjusted to maintain Hb levels 
      within +/-1.0 g/dL of the reference concentration and between 10.5 and 12.5 g/dL.
      The Hb reference concentration was defined as the mean of all Hb levels during
      screening. The primary end point was the proportion of patients maintaining a
      mean Hb concentration (g/dL) within +/-1 g/dL of their reference Hb and between
      10.5 and 12.5 g/dL during the EEP. RESULTS: A total of 163 patients from 27
      centers in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay,
      and Venezuela entered the treatment period and 102 completed the prescribed
      course of C.E.R.A. Forty-five patients (43.7 %) maintained a mean Hb
      concentration within +/-1 g/dL of their reference Hb value and between 10.5 and
      12.5 g/dL during the EEP. The median monthly dose remained constant at 120 mug
      during the titration period and during the EEP. On the average, there were only
      2.3 dose changes per patient in 28 weeks of treatment, covering 7 C.E.R.A.
      scheduled administrations. 53 % of all dose changes were dose decreases, 47 %
      increases. A total of 10 AEs and 4 SAEs were considered to be related to the
      study treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Once-monthly C.E.R.A. treatment effectively
      maintains stable Hb concentrations in patients with chronic renal anemia
      undergoing dialysis with a good safety and tolerability profile.

AB  - AIM: To analyze the benefits of an inhaled analgesia procedure over intrapartum
      pain and the degree of satisfaction of using this method. METHODS: This was a
      pilot study carried out at a low-income hospital setting in which women with
      singleton pregnancies, cephalic presentation and active phase of labor were
      requested to inhale ad libitum a 50-50 % mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen
      (N(2)O-O(2)) (Oxicalm((R)), Indura S.A-Indura Ecuador) using a face mask with an 
      auto-demand valve. Effect over labor pain and dynamics and side effects were
      recorded. RESULTS: A total of 126 gravids participated with a mean age of 21.6
      +/- 6.7 years, 50.8 % of which were adolescents. As assessed by the Visual Analog
      Scale 1 h after initiating the procedure pain significantly decreased 56.2 % on
      average (8.9-4.9 points, p = 0.001), while increasing cervical dilation and
      effacement by 28.4 and 21.7 %, respectively. Overall vaginal delivery was
      achieved in 96.9 % of cases, with an average procedure initiation to delivery
      time interval of 2 +/- 1 h and mixture consumption of 0.93 kg. Vaginal delivery
      rates were 36.5, 78.6 and 89.7 % for the first, second and third hour,
      respectively. During that time maternal hemodynamic parameters remained
      unaltered. Mean duration of the second stage of delivery was 6.2 min. Obstetrical
      and neonatal outcome was otherwise favorable. Main adverse effect of using the
      mixture was dizziness (43.7 %) referred by gravids as mild and tolerable. A 96 % 
      of users answered that they would recommend the method and graded it in 92.9 % as
      good/excellent. CONCLUSION: Inhaled intrapartum analgesia using a N(2)O-O(2)
      50-50 % mixture provided rapid pain alleviation. It is an appealing, effective
      and safe method for the management of pain during labor, most useful at
      institutions with infrastructure and personnel limitations.

TI  - Ecological factors related to the widespread distribution of sylvatic Rhodnius
      ecuadoriensis populations in southern Ecuador.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-17 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chagas disease transmission risk is a function of the presence of
      triatomines in domestic habitats. Rhodnius ecuadoriensis is one of the main
      vectors implicated in transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in Ecuador. This
      triatomine species is present in domestic, peridomestic and sylvatic habitats in 
      the country. To determine the distribution of sylvatic populations of R.
      ecuadoriensis and the factors related to this distribution, triatomine searches
      were conducted between 2005 and 2009 in southern Ecuador. METHODS: Manual
      triatomine searches were conducted by skilled bug collectors in 23 communities.
      Sylvatic searched sites were selected by a) directed sampling, where
      microhabitats were selected by the searchers and b) random sampling, where
      sampling points where randomly generated. Domiciliary triatomine searches were
      conducted using the one man-hour method. Natural trypanosome infection was
      determined by microscopic examination and PCR. Generalized linear models were
      used to test the effect of environmental factors on the presence of sylvatic
      triatomines. RESULTS: In total, 1,923 sylvatic individuals were collected
      representing a sampling effort of 751 man-hours. Collected sylvatic triatomines
      were associated with mammal and bird nests. The 1,219 sampled nests presented an 
      infestation index of 11.9%, a crowding of 13 bugs per infested nest, and a
      colonization of 80% of the nests. Triatomine abundance was significantly higher
      in squirrel (Sciurus stramineus) nests located above five meters from ground
      level and close to the houses. In addition, 8.5% of the 820 examined houses in
      the same localities were infested with triatomines. There was a significant
      correlation between R. ecuadoriensis infestation rates found in sylvatic and
      synanthropic environments within communities (p = 0.012). Parasitological
      analysis revealed that 64.7% and 15.7% of the sylvatic bugs examined (n = 300)
      were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and T. rangeli respectively, and 8% of the
      bugs presented mixed infections. CONCLUSIONS: The wide distribution of sylvatic
      R. ecuadoriensis populations may jeopardize the effectiveness of control
      campaigns conducted to eliminate domestic populations of this species. Also, the 
      high T. cruzi infection rates found in sylvatic R. ecuadoriensis populations in
      southern Ecuador could constitute a risk for house re-infestation and persistent 
      long-term Chagas disease transmission in the region.

TI  - First Report of Orange Rust of Sugarcane Caused by Puccinia kuehnii in Colombia.
PG  - 143
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-05-11-0406 [doi]
AB  - Symptoms of sugarcane orange rust were first observed in July 2010 on sugarcane
      (interspecific hybrid of Saccharum L. species) cv. CC 01-1884 planted in the La
      Cabana Sugar Mill, Puerto Tejada, Colombia. Morphological features of uredinial
      lesions and urediniospores inspected with an optical microscope and scanning
      electron microscopy were distinct from common rust of sugarcane caused by
      Puccinia melanocephala Syd. & P. Syd., revealing spores identical morphologically
      to those described for the fungus P. kuehnii (Kruger) E. Butler, causal agent of 
      sugarcane orange rust (1,3). Uredinial lesions were orange and distinctly lighter
      in color than pustules of P. melanocephala. Urediniospores were orange to light
      cinnamon brown, mostly ovoid to pyriform, variable in size (27.3 to 39.2 x 16.7
      to 21.2 mum), with pronounced apical wall and moderately echinulate with spines
      evenly distributed. Paraphyses, telia, and teliospores were not observed.
      Species-specific PCR primers designed from the internal transcribed spacer
      (ITS)1, ITS2, and 5.8S rDNA regions of P. melanocephala and P. kuehnii were used 
      to differentiate the two species (2). The primers Pm1-F and Pm1-R amplified a
      480-bp product from P. melanocepahala DNA in leaf samples with symptoms of common
      rust. By contrast, the primers Pk1-F and Pk1-R generated a 527-bp product from
      presumed P. kuehnii DNA in leaf samples with signs of orange rust, confirming the
      identity as P. kuehnii. The Centro de Investigacion de la Cana de Azucar de
      Colombia (Cenicana) started a survey of different cultivars in nurseries and
      experimental and commercial fields in the Cauca River Valley and collected leaf
      samples for additional analyses. Experimental cvs. CC 01-1884, CC 01-1866, and CC
      01-1305 were found to be highly susceptible to orange rust and were eliminated
      from regional trials, whereas commercial cvs. CC 85-92 and CC 84-75, the most
      widely grown cultivars, were resistant. With the discovery of orange rust of
      sugarcane in Colombia, Cenicana has incorporated orange rust resistance in the
      selection and development of new cultivars. To our knowledge, this is the first
      report of P. kuehnii on sugarcane in Colombia. Orange rust has also been reported
      from the United States, Cuba, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa
      Rica, Panama, Ecuador, and Brazil. References: (1) J. C. Comstock et al. Plant

AB  - Although previous epidemiological surveys in Ecuador indicate the presence of
      Entamoeba histolytica, prevalence data of this parasite remain scarce. Most of
      the studies were based on microscopic examination, which does not allow a
      morphological differentiation from the non-pathogenic Ent. dispar and Ent.
      moshkovskii. In the present study, 674 stool samples from a South Ecuadorian
      rural community were screened for Entamoeba spp. Subsequently, molecular
      identification was performed on 101 samples containing Ent. histolytica/Ent.
      dispar/Ent. moshkovskii cysts. The study indicated the absence of Ent.
      histolytica in this South Ecuadorian community and confirmed the difficulty of
      differentiating Entamoeba spp. based on morphological features.

LID - 10.1098/rsif.2011.0499 [doi]
AB  - The evolution of antibiotic resistance (AR) increases treatment cost and
      probability of failure, threatening human health worldwide. The relative
      importance of individual antibiotic use, environmental transmission and rates of 
      introduction of resistant bacteria in explaining community AR patterns is poorly 
      understood. Evaluating their relative importance requires studying a region where
      they vary. The construction of a new road in a previously roadless area of
      northern coastal Ecuador provides a valuable natural experiment to study how
      changes in the social and natural environment affect the epidemiology of
      resistant Escherichia coli. We conducted seven bi-annual 15 day surveys of AR
      between 2003 and 2008 in 21 villages. Resistance to both ampicillin and
      sulphamethoxazole was the most frequently observed profile, based on antibiogram 
      tests of seven antibiotics from 2210 samples. The prevalence of enteric bacteria 
      with this resistance pair in the less remote communities was 80 per cent higher
      than in more remote communities (OR = 1.8 [1.3, 2.3]). This pattern could not be 
      explained with data on individual antibiotic use. We used a transmission model to
      help explain this observed discrepancy. The model analysis suggests that both
      transmission and the rate of introduction of resistant bacteria into communities 
      may contribute to the observed regional scale AR patterns, and that village-level
      antibiotic use rate determines which of these two factors predominate. While
      usually conceived as a main effect on individual risk, antibiotic use rate is
      revealed in this analysis as an effect modifier with regard to community-level
      risk of resistance.

TI  - Field evaluation of urine antigen detection for diagnosis of Taenia solium
      cysticercosis.
PG  - 574-8
LID - 10.1016/j.trstmh.2011.05.010 [doi]
AB  - (Neuro)cysticercosis is an important zoonotic disease caused by infection with
      Taenia solium metacestode larvae. Existing immunodiagnostic techniques detect
      antibodies and circulating antigens (Ag) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
      Blood/CSF collection is an invasive procedure associated with blood-borne
      infections and is often not well accepted by communities. Detection of
      circulating Ag in urine has been suggested as an alternative, however this has
      been evaluated in clinical settings only. The aim of the present study was to
      evaluate the performance of a urine Ag-ELISA under field conditions. Paired serum
      and urine samples were obtained from participants in endemic areas of Ecuador
      (n=748) and Zambia (n=690) and were subjected to a monoclonal antibody-based
      Ag-ELISA. Calculation of positive and negative agreement indices (AI) showed
      better agreement in the negative direction both for Ecuadorian and Zambian
      samples (AI of 93.1 and 86.8, respectively). Using a Bayesian approach to
      determine the test characteristics, similar sensitivities were obtained for serum
      and urine Ag detection, whereas a decreased specificity was determined for the
      urine Ag-ELISA with a lower specificity (78.6%) for Zambian samples than for
      Ecuadorian samples (88.4%). This study indicates a higher specificity for the
      serum test under field conditions and promotes further research to improve the
      urine test.

TI  - Urbanisation is associated with prevalence of childhood asthma in diverse, small 
      rural communities in Ecuador.
PG  - 1043-50
LID - 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2011-200225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies conducted in transitional communities from Africa and Asia
      have pointed to the process of urbanisation as being responsible for the increase
      in asthma prevalence in developing regions. In Latin America, there are few
      published data available on the potential impact of urbanisation on asthma
      prevalence. The aim of the present study was to explore how the process of
      urbanisation may explain differences in asthma prevalence in transitional
      communities in north-eastern Ecuador. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An
      ecological study was conducted in 59 communities in Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador.
      Indicators of urbanisation were grouped into three indices representing the
      processes associated with urbanisation: socioeconomic, lifestyle and urban
      infrastructure. Categorical principal components analysis was used to generate
      scores for each index and a fourth index--a summary urbanisation index--was
      derived from the most representative variables in each of the three indices. The 
      authors analysed the associations between community asthma prevalence and the
      indices, as well as with each indicator variable of every group. The overall
      prevalence of asthma was 10.1% (range 0-31.4% between communities). Three of the 
      four indices presented significant associations with community asthma prevalence:
      socioeconomic (r = 0.295, p = 0.023), lifestyle (r = 0.342, p = 0.008) and
      summary urbanisation index (r = 0.355, p = 0.006). Variables reflecting better
      socioeconomic status and a more urban lifestyle were associated with greater
      asthma prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that the prevalence
      of asthma increases with increasing levels of urbanisation in transitional
      communities, and factors associated with greater socioeconomic level and changes 
      towards a more urban lifestyle may be particularly important.

TI  - Morphometric and molecular differentiation of a Rhodnius robustus-like form from 
      R. robustus Larousse, 1927 and R. prolixus Stal, 1859 (Hemiptera, Reduviidae).
PG  - 103-9
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.06.009 [doi]
AB  - In Triatominae, "robustus" group constitutes a cluster of species with great
      haplotypic divergences but high similarities at morphological and nuclear DNA
      levels. Given these similarities, species identification generates a frequently
      problematic issue. In northwestern Amazonia, Rhodnius robustus cohabit with an
      apparently new species, cryptic with R. robustus (Abad-Franch and Monteiro,
      2005). In this region (municipality of Puerto Asis, Department of Putumayo,
      Colombia), we collected insects classified as R. robustus by traditional keys. We
      compared this sample with specimens of R. robustus from Venezuela, and of R.
      prolixus from Colombia and Venezuela. The comparisons used landmark-based
      geometric morphometrics, and analyses of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and of
      D2 variable region of the 28S RNA. The shape of the wings from Puerto Asis
      specimens disclosed clear-cut divergence from the shape of the wings as found for
      R. prolixus specimens from Venezuela and Colombia, and diverged from the shape of
      R. robustus from Venezuela. Thus, morphometric analyses suggested that the Puerto
      Asis collection could represent a new taxon. Using R. pallescens as an outgroup, 
      a tentative phylogenetic tree based on the geometry of the wing showed the
      Rhodnius from Puerto Asis more similar to the R. prolixus from Colombia than
      their congeners from Venezuela. In contrast, the molecular classification
      clustered Colombian R. prolixus and Venezuelan R. robustus with published GenBank
      sequences, but it gave the insects from Puerto Asis a basal position to the
      "robustus" group. This outcome suggests that the Puerto Asis haplotype could be
      the one found by Abad-Franch and Monteiro (2005). Thus, both morphometric and
      molecular markers used here, although differing in the phylogenetic
      classification of samples, could differentiate the Puerto Asis sample from the
      morphologically similar R. prolixus and R. robustus. This could represent a
      valuable help in the entomological surveillance related to the control of Chagas 
      disease in the South of Colombia and North of Ecuador.

      multiplex.
PG  - e105-7
LID - 10.1016/j.fsigen.2011.03.006 [doi]
AB  - A total of 119 unrelated individuals from two of the major ethnic groups in
      Ecuador were typed for 49 of the autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      in the SNPforID 52plex using the SNapShot((R)) assay. Of the above, 42 samples
      originated from Mestizos (an admixed population) and the remaining 77 were from
      Native Amerindian Kichwas. We obtained full SNP profiles in all individuals and
      concordance of duplicated analyses. No deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
      (HWE) was observed for any SNP in the Mestizo and Kichwa populations and only one
      and four pairs of loci, respectively showed significant linkage disequilibrium. A
      relatively low genetic diversity and global positive F(IS) value was observed in 
      Kichwas. A statistically significant global F(ST) value was obtained when the two
      Ecuadorian populations were compared with populations in Spain, Portugal,
      Argentina, Denmark, Greenland, China, Somalia and Mozambique. All pairwise F(ST) 
      values were statistically significant. A multi-dimensional scaling based on
      pairwise F(ST) values showed that the Kichwa population differed from all other
      populations investigated and that the Mestizos had an intermediate position
      between Kichwas and Europeans. An admixture analysis indicated that the greater
      contributor to the Mestizo population was the Kichwas (71.2%) compared to the
      European contribution. The combined mean match probability and mean paternity
      exclusion probability were 3.3 x 10(-17) and 0.998, respectively, for the Mestizo
      population and 3.3 x 10(-14) and 0.993, respectively, for the Kichwa population.

TI  - First Report of Potato yellowing virus (Genus Ilarvirus) in Solanum phureja from 
      Ecuador.
PG  - 355
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-09-10-0624 [doi]
AB  - A bacilliform virus, named Potato yellowing virus (PYV), causing chlorosis of
      leaves was reported in 1992 in potato (Solanum tuberosum) fields in Peru (1) and 
      symptomless wild potatoes (S. fernandezianum) in Chile (4). PYV is reported as an
      alfamo-like virus (1) (family Bromoviridae) but no sequence information is
      available for this virus, making its taxonomic position inside the Bromoviridae
      uncertain (currently this family is organized into five genera: Alfamovirus,
      Bromovirus, Cucumovirus, Ilarvirus, and Oleavirus). Herein we report the presence
      of PYV in native potatoes (Solanum phureja) collected from Ecuador where the crop
      constitutes an important source of income in rural communities. Forty accessions 
      of S. phureja collected in Ecuador in June 1986 and maintained in vitro at the
      International Potato Center (CIP) germplasm bank were analyzed by double-antibody
      sandwich (DAS)-ELISA with antiserum raised against a Peruvian isolate of PYV (1).
      PYV was detected in six accessions (15% of the material) corresponding to
      cultivars Chaucha Tomate and Chaucha Blanca (from the province of Canar), Chaucha
      Negra Ojona and Chaucha Amarilla (Loja Province), and Cuica and Chaucha (Azuay
      Province). Mechanical inoculation of the indicator plant Physalis floridiana with
      leaf extracts of these six plants, a PYV isolate from Peru (1) (positive
      control), and an additional four plants testing negative for PYV (negative
      controls) induced symptoms of mosaic and leaf deformation only with the six
      clones from Ecuador and the PYV isolate from Peru. To further confirm the
      presence of the virus, we used universal PCR primers designed for the
      Bromoviridae (Ilar1F5: 5'-GCNGGWTGYGGDAARWCNAC-3' and Ilar1R7:
      5'-AMDGGWAYYTGYTYNGTRTCACC-3') that target the helicase motif (RNA1) (3). Total
      RNA was extracted from 200 mg of leaf material (from potato and mechanically
      inoculated P. floridiana) using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the
      manufacturer's instructions and cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer
      primers. We obtained a reverse transcription-PCR amplified band only from samples
      that were DAS-ELISA positive to PYV. To identify the virus at the genus level, we
      cloned the PCR fragments (265 nucleotides) from four of the samples from Ecuador 
      and the Peruvian isolate into plasmid vectors (pGEM-T Easy Vector cloning system;
      Promega, Madison, WI) for Sanger sequencing (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea).
      Phylogenetic analysis grouped PYV sequences with those of the genus Ilarvirus.
      Among the ilarviruses, Fragaria chiloensis latent virus (2) was the closest
      relative of PYV, with which it shares 77% nucleotide and 85% amino acid sequence 
      identity. PYV isolates from Ecuador split into two different variants (91%
      identity) that shared 93% nucleotide and 99% amino acid sequence identity with
      the Peruvian isolate. Collectively, the data suggest that PYV is a distinct
      ilarvirus and that it is more widely spread among South American potatoes than
      previously suggested. The GenBank Accession Numbers for the sequences described
      are: HQ141053 (Loja1), HQ141054 (Azuay), HQ141055 (Canar), and HQ141056 (Loja2)
      for the isolates from Ecuador and HQ141057 (PYV-Canete) for the isolate from
      Peru. References: (1) S. Fuentes and U. Jayasinghe. Fitopatologia 28:22, 1993.

TI  - Phenotypic variability of Rhodnius ecuadoriensis populations at the Ecuadorian
      central and southern Andean region.
PG  - 1034-43
AB  - Rhodnius ecuadoriensis is an important vector of Chagas disease in Ecuador.
      Whereas only sylvatic and peridomestic populations are common in Manabi province,
      this species occupies domestic, peridomestic, and sylvatic habitats in Loja
      province where high reinfestation of houses was observed. To explore the
      existence of phenetic changes linked to the domiciliation of the species, this
      study set out to analyze the wing and antennal phenotypes of R. ecuadoriensis in 
      these two provinces where the vector presents different affinity for domestic
      habitats. The antennal phenotype and the wing size and shape distinguish the two 
      geographical populations of R. ecuadoriensis. In Manabi, sylvatic and
      peridomestic specimens were very similar. In Loja, sylvatic and nonsylvatic
      (domestic and peridomestic) populations showed distinctive characteristics.
      Remarkable sexual dimorphism of wing and antenna, exclusive of domestic
      specimens, and high metric disparity in the wing shape of the domestic females
      point out the existence of a particular situation in this habitat. The results of
      this phenotypic analysis and previous evidence of behavioral differences support 
      the hypothesis of disruptive selection acting upon R. ecuadoriensis populations.

TI  - The time of day and the interval since previous meal are associated with plasma
      zinc concentrations and affect estimated risk of zinc deficiency in young
      children in Peru and Ecuador.
PG  - 184-90
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2010.234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Plasma zinc concentration is the preferred biomarker of
      zinc status, but the time of day and time since previous meals can modify the
      results. Measuring fasting plasma zinc concentration is not feasible among young 
      children, so adjustments need to be developed for interpreting results. Our
      objective is to develop correction factors to adjust for the effects of time of
      day and interval since the previous meal when measuring plasma zinc
      concentrations of young children. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We measured plasma zinc
      concentrations among young Peruvian (n =297) and Ecuadorian (n=466) children, and
      constructed regression models adjusting for time of day, interval since previous 
      meal and infections. RESULTS: Plasma zinc concentrations were positively related 
      to the number of hours since the previous meal in the Peru trial (r =0.22,
      P<0.0001) and negatively related to the time of day of blood sampling in both
      Peru (r = -0.24, P<0.0001) and Ecuador (r = -0.18, P<0.001). In multivariate
      models, plasma zinc concentrations were ~2 mug per 100 ml less for each hour
      later in the morning when blood samples were collected, in both populations, and 
      concentrations were ~1.0 mug per 100 ml greater for every hour since previous
      meal consumption in Peru. The percentage of children with low plasma zinc
      concentrations varied according to both these factors. CONCLUSIONS: The time of
      day and the interval since the preceding meal should be recorded when measuring
      plasma zinc concentration and incorporated into the statistical analysis and
      interpretation when assessing population zinc status.

TI  - Hierarchical Y-SNP assay to study the hidden diversity and phylogenetic
      relationship of native populations in South America.
PG  - 100-4
LID - 10.1016/j.fsigen.2010.08.016 [doi]
AB  - Studying the Y chromosomes of indigenous tribes of Ecuador revealed a lack of
      strategic SNP assays to examine the substructure of South American native
      populations. In most studies dealing with South American samples so far only the 
      most common Y-SNP M3 of haplogroup Q was analyzed, because this is known to
      define a founder group in South America. Studies of SNPs ancestral to Q-M3
      (Q1a3a) to confirm the results or the typing of Q subclades have often been
      neglected. For this reason we developed a SNaPshot assay, which allows first for 
      a hierarchical testing of all main haplogroups occurring in South American
      populations and second for a detailed analysis of haplogroups Q and C thought
      having ancient Asian descent. We selected 16 SNPs from the YCC haplogroup tree
      and established two multiplexes. The first multiplex ("SA Major") includes 12
      Y-SNPs defining the most frequent haplogroups occurring in South America (M42,
      M207, M242, M168, M3, M145, M174, M213, RPS4Y711, M45, P170, and M9). The second 
      multiplex ("SA SpecQ") contains Y-SNPs of haplogroup Q, especially of the
      subclade Q-M3 (M19, M194, P292, M3, and M199). Within our Ecuadorian sample,
      haplogroup Q-M3 (xM19, M194, P292, and M199) was predominant, but we also found
      haplogroup E and R, which can be attributed to recent admixture. Moreover, we
      found four out of 65 samples, which were tested to be haplogroup C3* (C-M217) the
      modal haplogroup in Mongolians and widespread in indigenous populations of the
      Russian Far East as well as in Eastern Asia. This haplogroup is not known to be
      the result of recent admixture and has been found only one time before in South
      America. Since haplogroup C occurs in Asia and in North America (C3b or C-P39),
      we assume that these C-lineages are ancient as well. Therefore, we established a 
      third multiplex ("SA SpecC"), which allows the further subtyping of haplogroup C,
      mainly of subclade C3 defined by the Y-SNP M217 (M407, M48, P53.1, M217, P62,
      RPS4Y711, M93, M86, and P39). Altogether, these three multiplexes cover the most 
      frequent haplogroups in South America and allow for a maximal resolution of the
      Y-chromosomal SNP diversity in Amerindian population samples.

TI  - Life history, immune function, and intestinal helminths: Trade-offs among
      immunoglobulin E, C-reactive protein, and growth in an Amazonian population.
PG  - 836-48
LID - 10.1002/ajhb.21092 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infection with helminths is associated with shifts in host immunity, 
      including increased production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and reduced
      inflammation. Given limited energy budgets, these shifts may involve changes in
      energy allocation toward competing demands. Here we test for potential trade-offs
      between growth, IgE, and the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP).
      METHODS: Dried blood spots and anthropometrics were collected from 162 Shuar
      forager-horticulturalists from a village in southeastern Ecuador. Enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to measure IgE and CRP. Relationships
      among IgE, CRP, and anthropometrics were examined in three groups: children aged 
      2-7 years (n = 63), children aged 8-15 (n = 61), and adults over age 18 (n = 37).
      RESULTS: Geometric mean IgE was 1,196 IU ml(-)(1) while geometric mean CRP was
      1.33 mg l(-)(1). In children, IgE and CRP were negatively correlated (r = -0.21, 
      P = 0.02, df = 122). Controlling for fat stores and age, IgE was associated with 
      lower stature in children (t = -2.04, P = 0.04, df = 109), and adults (t = -3.29,
      P < 0.01, df = 33). In children there was a significant interaction between age
      and CRP, such that in younger children CRP was associated with shorter stature,
      but in older children was associated with greater stature (t = 2.15, P = 0.04, df
      = 109). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that infection with helminths may have
      hidden costs associated with immunological changes, and that these costs may
      ultimately affect growth and other life history parameters.

TI  - Snake bite envenomation in Ecuador.
PG  - 588-91
LID - 10.1016/j.trstmh.2010.05.006 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the burden of snake bite in Ecuador and to 
      identify the difficulties of snake bite management in Ecuadorian health
      facilities. A survey based on national health statistics was carried out in
      Ecuador to estimate the overall incidence and mortality due to snake bites.
      During the period 1998-2007, the average annual incidence and mortality was
      respectively 11 and 0.5 per 100 000 inhabitants. The at-risk population was
      represented mainly by males aged 10-54 years. Snake bite incidence increased
      during the rainy season and El Nino. According to one data source, the majority
      of snake bites occurred in the coastal region (56%) compared with the Amazonian
      rainforest (11%) and the highlands (33%). This geographical variation in snake
      bite incidence may reflect the distribution of venomous snakes and human
      population densities and activities. This preliminary national survey on the
      incidence of the envenomings due to snake bite in Ecuador showed a stable
      incidence over the time period studied but was heterogeneous in the three
      geographical regions of Ecuador. The incidence and mortality were higher in the
      lowland humid regions where Bothrops species are abundant.

TI  - First Report of Crown Rot and Stem Rot Caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG-4 on
      Marmalade Bush in Italy.
PG  - 486
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-94-4-0486B [doi]
AB  - Marmalade bush (Streptosolen jamesonii (Benth.) Miers), also known as fire bush, 
      is an evergreen, perennial shrub in the family Solanaceae, which is native to
      South America (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru). In Italy, this species is cultivated
      as an ornamental creeper or bush. During September 2009, a new disease was
      observed in a stock of ~10,000 pot-grown, 2-month-old plants of marmalade bush in
      a nursery in eastern Sicily, Italy. More than 50% of the plants exhibited
      symptoms of disease. Disease symptoms consisted of extensive water-soaked, dark
      brown lesions at the crown level that girdled entire stems and an internal brown 
      discoloration of cortical tissue. Infected plants died within a few days.
      Diseased tissue was disinfested for 10 s in 1% NaOCl, rinsed with sterile water, 
      and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin sulfate at 100
      mg/liter. Fungal colonies were initially white, turned brown after 2 to 3 days,
      and produced irregularly shaped, brown sclerotia. Microscopic examination showed 
      mycelium consistent with Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn that branched at right angles,
      constricted at the base of the branch originating from primary hyphae, and
      septate near the constriction. The number of nuclei per hyphal cell was
      determined on cultures grown at 25 degrees C on 2% water agar in petri plates by 
      staining with 1% safranin O and 3% KOH solution (1) and examined at x400. The
      hyphal cells were all multinucleate. Anastomosis group was determined by pairing 
      isolates on 2% water agar in petri plates (2). Pairings were made with tester
      strains AG-1 IA, AG-2-2-1, AG-2-2IIIB, AG-2-2IV, AG-3, AG-4, AG-5, AG-6, and
      AG-11. Anastomosis was observed only with tester isolates of AG-4. Pathogenicity 
      tests were performed by placing 1-cm(2) plugs of PDA from 5-day-old mycelial
      cultures near the base of the stem on 25 potted, healthy, 2-month-old rooted
      cuttings of marmalade bush. The same number of plants treated with 1-cm(2) PDA
      plugs served as controls. Following inoculation, all plants were maintained for
      20 days at 25 degrees C and 95% relative humidity under a 12-h fluorescent
      light/dark regimen. Crown and stem symptoms, identical to those observed in the
      nursery, developed 5 days after inoculation on all inoculated plants. Control
      plants remained symptomless. R. solani was consistently reisolated from
      symptomatic tissues and identified as previously described. To our knowledge,
      this is the first report of R. solani causing disease on marmalade bush.

TI  - Cross-cultural evaluation of the modified Parkinson Psychosis Rating Scale across
      disease stages.
PG  - 1391-8

AB  - This study assessed the psychometric attributes of the modified Parkinson
      Psychosis Rating Scale (mPPRS). In an attempt to improve scale's scaling
      assumptions and content validity, all types of hallucinations were rated and all 
      items were scored based on intensity. The scale was cross-culturally adapted to
      four Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Paraguay).
      Acceptability, internal consistency, factor structure, convergent and
      known-groups validity, and precision (standard error of measurement, SEM) were
      explored. A total of 388 patients with PD were included in the study (age, 64.5
      +/- 10.7 years; 59.8% males; PD duration, 8.2 +/- 4.9 years). The mPPRS was
      highly usable in terms of missing values generated and scores distribution (total
      computable scores, 99.7%, ceiling effect, <15%). Scaling assumptions were
      acceptable as noted by the range of item-total correlations (0.14-0.55, only one 
      coefficient below 0.2). Internal consistency was adequate for research use
      (Cronbach alpha, 0.7). Factor analysis identified two factors that accounted for 
      58.5% of the variance. Low correlation coefficients were found with cognitive
      function (SCOPA-Cog) and disease severity (CISI-PD) (r(S) <or= 0.30), whereas
      correlation with psychosis were high (r(S) = 0.56). Known-groups validity
      analyses indicated a significant increase in mPPRS scores by Hoehn and Yahr stage
      (P < 0.001). The SEM value was 1.06. Overall, the results suggest that the mPPRS 
      is a useful tool for evaluation of psychosis in PD. The results show that some
      psychometric properties of the mPPRS are satisfactory albeit there is room for
      the improvement of scale's content validity and internal consistency. (c) 2010

AB  - Eight Vibrio isolates originating from the marine corals Mussismilia hispida and 
      Phyllogorgia dilatata and the zoanthids Palythoa caribaeorum and Palythoa
      variabilis in Brazil and the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) in
      Ecuador were studied by means of a polyphasic approach. The novel isolates formed
      a tight monophyletic group in the genus Vibrio and were closely related to
      species of the Vibrio harveyi group, to which they showed more than 99 % 16S rRNA
      gene sequence similarity. Analysis based on concatenated sequences of the
      following seven genes, 16S rRNA, gyrB, recA, rpoA, topA, pyrH and mreB (5633 bp
      in length), showed clear separation between the isolates and species of the V.
      harveyi group. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, performed 
      previously, revealed that a representative isolate of this group, LMG 20370, was 
      clearly separate from known Vibrio species (it belonged to the so-called AFLP
      cluster A31). DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) experiments with representative
      isolates and type strains of the V. harveyi species group revealed high DDH
      between the novel isolates (more than 74 %) and less than 70 % DDH towards type
      strains of related Vibrio species, proving the novel species status of the
      isolates. Phenotypically, the novel species belongs to the arginine dihydrolase
      (A)-negative, lysine decarboxylase (L)-positive and ornithine decarboxylase
      (O)-positive (A-/L+/O+) cluster reported previously. Most species of the V.
      harveyi group (i.e. Vibrio rotiferianus, V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus and V.
      alginolyticus) also belong to this A-/L+/O+ cluster. However, several phenotypic 
      features can be used for the identification of the novel species. In contrast to 
      its closest phylogenetic neighbours, the novel species exhibits esterase (C4) and
      N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities, but it does not produce acetoin, does
      not use citrate, alpha-ketoglutaric acid or propionic acid and does not ferment
      melibiose. The novel species can also be differentiated on the basis of the
      presence of the fatty acids C(17 : 0,) C(17 : 1)omega8c, iso-C(17 : 0) and
      iso-C(13 : 0) and the absence of the fatty acid C(18 : 0). The name Vibrio
      communis sp. nov. is proposed for this taxon. Strain R-40496(T) (=LMG 25430(T)
      =CAIM 1816(T)) is the type strain.

TI  - First Report of Clonostachys rhizophaga as a Pathogen of Dendrocalamus giganteus 
      in Mozambique.
PG  - 372
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-94-3-0372C [doi]
AB  - Dendrocalamus giganteus Wall. ex Munro, a wild plant belonging to the family
      Poaceae, is widespread in Mozambique where it is used as a construction material.
      At the end of 2007, disease symptoms have been observed on D. giganteus plants
      growing in the neighborhood of Maputo. Diseased plants showed longitudinal dark
      streaks on the stem surface to which corresponded internal vascular browning and 
      chlorosis in wide leaves that gradually developed into necrosis. At the final
      stage of the disease plants died. To isolate the pathogen, stem segments
      collected during September 2008 were surface sterilized with 1% HgCl2 for 30 s,
      rinsed with sterile deionized water for 30 s, and incubated on potato dextrose
      agar (PDA) medium at 22 degrees C in the dark for 2 weeks. Monosporic cultures of
      the isolated fungus formed dimorphic Verticillium-like (primary) or penicillate
      (secondary) conidiophores and ovoidal to elongate, minutely curved, hyaline
      conidia, 5 to 9.5 x 2.5 to 4.5 mum, with laterally displaced hilum. These
      characteristics are typical of Clonostachys rhizophaga Schroers (3).
      Identification was confirmed by the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures
      (Utrecht, the Netherlands) on the basis of the beta-tubulin (tub2) gene sequence 
      (3). For our isolate CBS 125416, the tub2 sequence was 100% similar to that of
      the C. rizhophaga strain CBS 124511 (GenBank Accession No. FJ 593883) (1). To
      verify the pathogenicity of the fungus, a 5-mm-diameter mycelial plug obtained
      from 2-week-old colonies grown on PDA was affixed to a portion of the stem of D. 
      giganteus from which the superficial tissues had been removed and the inoculation
      site was covered with wet cotton and wrapped with Parafilm. Control plants were
      treated by the same method but using PDA plugs without mycelium. Twenty plants
      were used, ten of which were controls. They were grown in a controlled climatic
      chamber at 22 degrees C with a photoperiod of 16 h at 40 muE.m(-2).s(-1). Two
      months after inoculation, all plants showed a dark area surrounded by an idropic 
      halo on the stem surface and internal browning, whereas control plants remained
      healthy. C. rhizophaga was recovered from all infected plants. C. rhizophaga is
      apparently rare. The fungus (as Verticillium rhizophagum Tehon & Jacobs, nom.
      invalid.) has been previously reported from the United States, Chile, and Ecuador
      (4) and as a culture contaminant in Switzerland (3). More recently C. rhizophaga 
      has been found to be associated with Pinus canariensis in Argentina (2) and it
      has been reported as a causal agent of chickpea wilt in Syria (1). To our
      knowledge, this is the first report of C. rhizophaga for subsaharian Africa. It
      may be under reported and more common than has been thought because of the
      difficulty in identifying Clonostachys species, but with the ability to identify 
      species using tub2 (3), there can be no doubt of its identity. References: (1) M.

AB  - Pyomyositis occurs when intramuscular abscesses appear in one or more body sites.
      Analysis of data from 165 patients with tropical pyomyositis diagnosed at a
      hospital in rural Amazonian Ecuador from 1980 to 1989 and 1995 to 2005 found that
      pyomyositis is more likely to affect males than females and more likely to affect
      children than adults. Abscesses were most commonly located on a lower extremity. 
      Significant changes in patients' profiles between 1980 and 1989 and 1995 and 2005
      were not found.

TI  - Trypanosoma rangeli genotypes association with Rhodnius prolixus and R.
      pallescens allopatric distribution in Central America.
PG  - 1306-10
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2009.09.002 [doi]
AB  - Previous kDNA polymorphism-based reports have revealed the existence of two
      Trypanosoma rangeli genotypes (KP1+ and KP1-): SL and SSU rRNA gene
      polymorphism-based studies have revealed that five genotypes (A-E) are
      distributed throughout different Latin-American countries. Some evidence has
      shown that the genotypes' biogeographical distribution is associated with
      sympatric Rhodnius species. 12 T. rangeli isolates from humans and reservoirs
      from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama were characterised
      by kDNA and mini-exon gene intergene spacer analysis and compared to 12
      previously characterised isolates from humans and vectors from Colombia,
      Guatemala, Honduras and Venezuela. Central American isolates corresponded to
      genotypes called KP1(+) or lineage A and KP1(-) or lineage C. Such dimorphism was
      corroborated by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) in 22 selected
      isolates; a dendrogram was thus produced having two defined branches. One branch 
      grouped KP1(-) or lineage C strains isolated from Rhodnius colombiensis
      (Colombia), humans (Panama), Procyon lotor and Choloepus hoffmanni (Costa Rica). 
      The other group was formed by KP1(+) or lineage A strains isolated from Rhodnius 
      prolixus (Colombia, Venezuela) and humans (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras).
      These results present evidence that both groups infect different mammals (humans,
      domestic and silvatic animals) having no association with any particular
      vertebrate species; however, T. rangeli KP1(+) or (A) strains have been isolated 
      in Central America in areas where R. prolixus circulate (Honduras, El Salvador
      and Guatemala) and KP1(-) or (C) strains have been isolated in areas where
      Rhodnius pallescens is the main vector (Panama and Costa Rica) indicating a
      parasite-vector association. The same lineages circulate in Andean countries
      (Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru), KP1+ being associated with members of
      the prolixus group (R. prolixus and Rhodnius robustus) and KP1- with members of
      the pallescens group (R. pallescens, R. colombiensis and Rhodnius ecuadoriensis).

PG  - 1823-9
LID - 10.1007/s00705-009-0499-1 [doi]
AB  - The Pan-American Health Organization established a rotavirus pre-vaccination
      disease burden and strain surveillance network in Latin America and the Caribbean
      in 2004. During strain surveillance in Ecuador in 2005-2006, a rare rotavirus
      genotype, G11P[6], was detected among common strains. Sequencing and phylogenetic
      analysis of this strain identified a novel lineage of the G11 VP7 gene, most
      closely related to A253 (91.8% nt identity), a porcine rotavirus strain
      identified in Venezuela. Most genes of this strain clustered with porcine,
      human-porcine or bovine-porcine reassortant strains; only VP6 and perhaps NSP2
      genes were more closely related to cognate genes of human rotaviruses. Thus, this
      strain was likely generated by gene reassortment between porcine and human
      parental strains. Our study provides further evidence that animal rotaviruses
      play an important role in genetic and antigenic diversity of rotaviruses
      pathogenic for humans.

PG  - 674-80
AB  - Six new species of Rhachomyces from Ecuador are described and illustrated. These 
      are R. dimorphus, parasitic on Diploharpus rossii (Carabidae, Perigoninae); R.
      elsae, parasitic on Adelopsis carolinae (Cholevidae, Ptomaphaginae); R. falcatus,
      parasitic on Palaminus sp. (Staphylinidae, Paederinae); R. moreti, parasitic on
      Trechisibus calathiformis (Carabidae, Trechinae); R. otongaensis, parasitic on
      Perigona sp. (Carabidae, Perigoninae); and R. venustus, parasitic on Megalopinus 
      robustus (Staphylinidae, Megalopsidiinae). Rhachomyces dimorphus is peculiar,
      displaying two different growth forms, one of which is found on the left foreleg 
      of male host insects, the other on the inferior, posterior margin of the
      prothorax of females. Each of the other new species also displays one or more
      unusual features.

TI  - Presence of Rhodnius ecuadoriensis in sylvatic habitats in the southern highlands
      (Loja Province) of Ecuador.
PG  - 708-11
AB  - The main vectors of Chagas disease in Ecuador are Triatoma dimidiata and Rhodnius
      ecuadoriensis. The latter species occupies domestic and peridomestic habitats, as
      well as sylvatic ecotopes--particularly associated with Phytelephas aequatorialis
      palm trees--in the western coastal region of Ecuador. In the southern highlands, 
      however, such palm tree habitats are uncommon, and sylvatic populations of R.
      ecuadoriensis have not previously been reported to date. This study was carried
      out in five rural communities in Loja Province in southern Ecuador, where manual 
      triatomine searches were conducted in various sylvatic habitats. A total of 81
      squirrel nests (Sciurus stramineus) and > 200 bird nests and other habitats were 
      searched. One hundred three R. ecuadoriensis individuals were found in 11
      squirrel nests (infestation index = 13.6%, density = 2 bugs per nest searched,
      crowding = 9.5 bugs per infested nest, colonization index = 72.7% of infested
      nests with nymphs). No triatomines were found in bird nests or other sylvatic
      habitats. The presence of sylvatic R. ecuadoriensis in the southern highlands of 
      Ecuador has important implications for the long-term control of Chagas disease in
      the region because of the possibility of reinfestation of dwellings after
      insecticide-based control interventions.

TI  - First Report of Chickpea Wilt Caused by Clonostachys rhizophaga in Syria.
PG  - 666
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-93-6-0666A [doi]
AB  - In 2007 and 2008, disease symptoms were observed on four cultivars of chickpea
      (Cicer arietinum L.), including two of the most popular cultivars grown in Syria 
      (Ghab 3 and Ghab 4), in a replicated on-farm trial conducted in the fertile Al
      Ghab Plains. Affected plants exhibited chlorosis of the foliage, vascular
      discoloration, and death. In both years, plant mortality reached 100% in plots of
      cvs. ICC 12004, Ghab 3, and Ghab 4, but only 60% in plots of cv. ILC 97-706. Five
      monosporic isolates obtained from surface-disinfested stems and roots were
      identified morphologically. All micromorphological characteristics indicated that
      the isolated fungi fit the description of Clonostachys rhizophaga Schroers (1).
      Wilting of chickpea was widespread in the area, and fungal isolations from a
      random sample of diseased plants in neighboring farmers' fields revealed the
      presence of C. rhizophaga. In culture, isolates formed dimorphic,
      Verticillium-like (primary) or penicillate (secondary) conidiophores and ovoidal 
      to elongate, slightly curved or asymmetrical, 5 to 9 mum long and 2.5 to 3.5 mum 
      wide conidia showing a slightly laterally displaced hilum. The identification of 
      the five isolates as C. rhizophaga was supported by sequencing approximately 600 
      bp of the beta-tubulin gene (tub2). Two representative sequences have been
      deposited under GenBank, Accession No. FJ593882 for strain CBS 124507 and No.
      FJ593883 for CBS 124511. Both were 100% similar to the sequence of C. rhizophaga 
      strain CBS 361.77 (GenBank Accession No. AF358158) but differed by a deletion of 
      2 nucleotides relative to the ex-type strain of C. rhizophaga, CBS 202.37
      (GenBank Accession No. AF358156). Two methods were used to inoculate plants and
      complete Koch's postulates. Method 1 used a 10-mm-diameter mycelial plug to
      inoculate healthy 3-day-old seedlings grown on 40 ml of Hoagland nutrient agar
      medium in a glass tube (one seedling per tube). The plug was placed mycelial-side
      down on the surface of the medium, and the fungus subsequently colonized the
      medium and penetrated the plant roots. Method 2 involved mixing autoclaved seed
      that had been colonized by each isolate with sterilized soil (1:12 vol/vol) prior
      to transplanting healthy seedlings into the soil mix. Thirty plants of each
      cultivar were tested per isolate per method, and controls received sterile agar
      plugs or autoclaved chickpea seed only. Irrespective of inoculation method, all
      five isolates caused wilt and plant death of all cultivars within 15 days (method
      1) or 2 months (method 2) postinoculation. Symptoms were similar to those
      originally observed in the field and controls remained healthy. C. rhizophaga was
      recovered from all affected plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of
      C. rhizophaga as a pathogen of chickpea. In an earlier report, C. rhizophaga (as 
      Verticillium rhizophagum Tehon & Jacobs, nom. invalid.) was identified as the
      causal agent of a disastrous disease of Ulmus americana in Ohio (2). C.
      rhizophaga has been reported from Chile, Ecuador, the United States, and
      Switzerland (1). References: (1) H.-J. Schroers. Stud. Mycol. 46:85, 2001. (2)

TI  - Policies and health care financing issues for dialysis in Latin America: extracts
      from the roundtable discussion on the economics of dialysis and chronic kidney
      disease.
PG  - S222-6
AB  - During the 2008 Congress of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,
      academic nephrologists, nephrology societies, and government officials from
      Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Central America, Ecuador, and Mexico
      participated in a roundtable discussion on the Economics of Dialysis and Chronic 
      Kidney Disease in Latin America. The main focus was policy and health care
      financing. The roundtable promoted open discussion between policymakers and
      clinicians on how to find viable solutions to contain spending on treatment for
      end-stage renal disease into the future. A number of options were proposed,
      including early medical intervention (disease management programs) to slow the
      progression of chronic kidney disease in high-risk patients, promotion of
      pre-emptive renal transplantation, and use of the most cost-effective dialysis
      therapy that can be offered to a patient without compromising outcome. It was
      concluded that the burden of treating more patients in the future could be
      alleviated by wider utilization of peritoneal dialysis (PD). However, important
      changes in health care reimbursement systems and realignment of incentives in the
      region are required to support wider PD penetration.

      mainly in children in certain populations in the Andean regions of South America,
      Mexico, and in the southwestern United States. Its clinical features, treatment, 
      and possible relation to duration of sun exposure have not been fully described
      in the ophthalmologic literature. METHODS: A 20-member ophthalmic team traveled
      to an Andean region of Ecuador to provide ophthalmic care to children. All
      children with conjunctivitis were examined. A novel 3-stage classification of
      actinic conjunctivitis, devised by one of the authors, was used to stage the
      disease. The parents of each child with actinic conjunctivitis were asked how
      much time the child spent outside. Histopathological evaluations were performed
      on children who underwent surgery. RESULTS: A total of 206 children were
      examined, of whom 36 had changes consistent with actinic conjunctivitis. Stage 1 
      disease was diagnosed in 17 children, stage 2 in 9, and stage 3 in 10 in the most
      severely affected eye. The amount of time the child spent outside correlated with
      disease severity (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). Histopathologic samples showed an intense
      inflammatory response with hyperplasia of the vascular endothelium, pigmentary
      migration, and occasional eosinophilia. CONCLUSIONS: Actinic conjunctivitis is
      prevalent among children of the highlands of Ecuador. Although it has an allergic
      component, our data suggest that the severity of the disease is significantly
      associated with sun exposure. The finding that the lesions are found only in the 
      exposed conjunctiva supports the hypothesis that UV exposure is the main cause of
      the disease.

PG  - 380-90
LID - 10.1177/0272989X08327330 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To relate the intuitive weight of harm by commission and harm by
      omission in therapeutic decisions for pulmonary tuberculosis, and to compare it
      with a weight based on probabilities. METHODS: Clinicians were asked for an
      estimation of probabilities related with the outcome of treated and nontreated
      pulmonary tuberculosis and for the toll of wrong decisions. Three ratios of the
      weight of forgoing a treatment in false-negative patients against the weight of
      treating false-positives were calculated. The first was based on intuitive
      estimations, whereas the second and third were based on calculated, either
      through intuitive estimations of probabilities or through literature data. The
      association between experience and the difference between the intuitive and the
      calculated ratios was assessed. RESULTS: Eighty-one participants from Ecuador,
      Laos, Nepal, and Rwanda responded. The ratio of intuitive weights was 2.0
      (interquartile range [IQR], 1.0-4.0) and the ratio of calculated weights based on
      intuitive probabilities was 64 (IQR, 25.0-169.6; P < 0.001). The ratio of
      calculated weight based on literature probabilities was 30 (IQR, 17.9-59.2). No
      association (R(2) = 0.03) was found between experience and accuracy in estimating
      the weight of errors. CONCLUSION: The weight of a false negative is more
      important than the weight of a false positive for therapeutic decisions in
      pulmonary tuberculosis. The ratio of the intuitively estimated weights was much
      lower than the calculation based on intuitively estimated influencing factors.
      Clinicians were accurate in estimating probabilities but failed to incorporate
      them into therapeutic decisions.

TI  - Landscape genetics, historical isolation and cross-Andean gene flow in the wax
      palm, Ceroxylon echinulatum (Arecaceae).
PG  - 3528-40
AB  - Knowledge of the role of landscapes in shaping genetic connectivity and
      divergence is essential for understanding patterns of biogeography and diversity.
      This is particularly relevant for the Andes region, a major biodiversity hotspot 
      of relatively recent origin. We examined the phylogeography and landscape
      genetics of the Andean wax palm Ceroxylon echinulatum (Arecaceae) that occurs in 
      two narrow bands of montane forests on each side of the Andes in Ecuador and
      northeastern Peru. First, we tested the hypothesis of C. echinulatum being a
      geographic cline species crossing the Andes in the Amotape-Huancabamba zone (AHZ)
      of southern Ecuador/northern Peru, as indicated by observations on fruit
      morphology. Second, we assessed the timeframe of cross-Andean divergence, and
      third, we investigated the impact of contemporary and historical landscape
      features on observed spatio-genetic patterns. Individual-based Bayesian
      clustering (BC) identified a northeastern, southeastern, southwestern, and
      northwestern cluster, with areas of genetic discontinuity coinciding with the
      Andes and the Giron-Paute deflection. F-statistics derived from BC suggested an
      east-to-west dispersal history. Population-based analyses revealed strong genetic
      structuring at both small and large geographic scales. Interpopulation
      relationships and Mantel tests strongly supported the cline model with
      cross-Andean dispersal in the AHZ. Along the cline, gene flow measured as F(ST)
      was mainly limited by distance, with less but significant impact of climatic
      friction. Coalescent analysis revealed that cross-Andean divergence took place
      during the Quaternary. Significant historical isolation (R(ST) > F(ST)) was found
      in the southwestern population. The current study illustrates a joint effect of
      founder dynamics, divergence by distance and historical isolation on patterns of 
      Andean diversity and distribution.

PG  - 690-5
LID - S0074-02762008000700011 [pii]
AB  - Rhodnius ecuadoriensis is the second most important vector of Chagas Disease (CD)
      in Ecuador. The objective of this study was to describe (and compare) the life
      cycle, the feeding and defecation patterns under laboratory conditions of two
      populations of this specie [from the provinces of Manabi (Coastal region) and
      Loja (Andean region)]. Egg-to-adult (n = 57) development took an average of 189.9
      +/- 20 (Manabi) and 181.3 +/- 6.4 days (Loja). Mortality rates were high among
      Lojan nymphs. Pre-feeding time (from contact with host to feeding initiation)
      ranged from 4 min 42 s [nymph I (NI)] to 8 min 30 s (male); feeding time ranged
      from 14 min 45 s (NI)-28 min 25 s (male) (Manabi) and from 15 min 25 s (NI)-28
      min 57 s (nymph V) (Loja). The amount of blood ingested increased significantly
      with instar and was larger for Manabi specimens (p < 0.001). Defecation while
      feeding was observed in Manabi specimens from stage nymph III and in Lojan bugs
      from stage nymph IV. There was a gradual, age-related increase in the frequency
      of this behaviour in both populations. Our results suggest that R. ecuadoriensis 
      has the bionomic traits of an efficient vector of Trypanosoma cruzi. Together
      with previous data on the capacity of this species to infest rural households,
      these results indicate that control of synanthropic R. ecuadoriensis populations 
      in the coastal and Andean regions may have a significant impact for CD control in
      Ecuador and Northern Peru.

TI  - Host Specificity of Phytophthora infestans on Tomato and Potato in Ecuador.
PG  - 265-71
LID - 10.1094/PHYTO.1998.88.3.265 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT Sixty Ecuadorian isolates of Phytophthora infestans from potato and 60
      isolates from tomato were compared for dilocus allozyme genotype, mitochondrial
      DNA haplotype, mating type, and specific virulence on 11 potato R-gene
      differential plants and four tomato cultivars, two of which contained different
      Ph genes. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) fingerprints of
      subsamples of isolates from each host were compared by using RG57 as the probe.
      All potato isolates had the allozyme genotype, haplotype, and mating type of the 
      clonal lineage EC-1, which had been previously described in Ecuador. With the
      same markers, only one isolate from tomato was classified as EC-1; all others
      belonged to the globally distributed US-1 clonal lineage. RFLP fingerprints of
      isolate subsets corroborated this clonal lineage classification. Specific
      virulence on potato differentials was broadest among potato isolates, while
      specific virulence on tomato cultivars was broadest among tomato isolates. Some
      tomato isolates infected all tomato differentials but no potato differentials,
      indicating that specific virulence for the two hosts is probably controlled by
      different avirulence genes in P. infestans. In two separate experiments, the
      diameters of lesions caused by nine isolates from potato and 10 from tomato were 
      compared on three tomato and three potato cultivars. All isolates produced larger
      lesions on the host from which they were isolated. No isolates were found that
      were highly aggressive on both tomato and potato. We conclude that there are two 
      different populations of P. infestans in Ecuador and that they are separated by
      host.

PG  - 2760-74

AB  - Many tropical forest tree species have broad geographic ranges, and fossil
      records indicate that population disjunctions in some species were established
      millions of years ago. Here we relate biogeographic history to patterns of
      population differentiation, mutational and demographic processes in the
      widespread rainforest tree Symphonia globulifera using ribosomal (ITS) and
      chloroplast DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) loci. Fossil records 
      document sweepstakes dispersal origins of Neotropical S. globulifera populations 
      from Africa during the Miocene. Despite historical long-distance gene flow, nSSR 
      differentiation across 13 populations from Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador (east and 
      west of Andes) and French Guiana was pronounced (F(ST)= 0.14, R(ST)= 0.39, P <
      0.001) and allele-size mutations contributed significantly (R(ST) > F(ST)) to the
      divergences between cis- and trans-Andean populations. Both DNA sequence and nSSR
      data reflect contrasting demographic histories in lower Mesoamerica and Amazonia.
      Amazon populations show weak phylogeographic structure and deviation from
      drift-mutation equilibrium indicating recent population expansion. In
      Mesoamerica, genetic drift was strong and contributed to marked differentiation
      among populations. The genetic structure of S. globulifera contains fingerprints 
      of drift-dispersal processes and phylogeographic footprints of geological uplifts
      and sweepstakes dispersal.

AB  - Within the framework of a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Capacity
      Building Project for training of laboratory staff in developing countries on
      persistent organic pollutant (POP) analysis, an interlaboratory study was
      organised following an initial evaluation of the performance of laboratories
      (reality check) and a series of training sessions. The target compounds were
      polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and organochlorine pesticides (OCP). Seven
      laboratories from five countries (Ecuador, Uruguay, Kenya, Moldova, and Fiji)
      participated. Most of the laboratories had no experience in determining PCBs.
      Although chromatograms improved considerably after the training and installation 
      of new gas chromatographic (GC) columns at participating laboratories, the level 
      of performance in the interlaboratory study was essentially on par with the
      moderate performance level achieved by European POP laboratories in the 1980s.
      Only some individual results were within +/-20% of the target values. The
      relative standard deviations (R.S.D.s) in POP concentrations determined by
      laboratories in a sediment sample were >200% in a number of cases. The results
      for a certified herring sample were better with at least some R.S.D. values below
      50% and most below 100%. Clean up was as one of the main sources of error. After 
      inspection it was ascertained that training of laboratory staff and investments
      in simple consumables such as glassware and GC columns would help to improve the 
      quality of the analysis more than major investments in expensive instrumentation.
      Creating an effective network of POP laboratories at different continents
      together with a series of interlaboratory studies and workshops is suggested to
      improve the measurements of POPs in these countries.

TI  - Neurotoxic envenoming by South American coral snake (Micrurus lemniscatus
      helleri): case report from eastern Ecuador and review.

LID - 10.1016/j.trstmh.2008.03.026 [doi]
AB  - A man bitten by a large coral snake (Micrurus lemniscatus helleri) in the Amazon 
      basin of Ecuador developed persistent excruciating pain in the bitten arm. On
      admission to hospital less than 30 min later, he had a polymorphonuclear
      leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia and mildly prolonged prothrombin time/partial
      thromboplastin time. Not until 14 h after the bite did he develop the first signs
      of neurotoxicity. Despite treatment with specific antivenom 50 h after the bite, 
      he required oxygen for respiratory failure 60 h, and 6 h of mechanical
      ventilation 72 h, after the bite. Over the next 38 h, he required two further
      intubations and periods of assisted ventilation before being airlifted to a
      tertiary referral hospital. Complications included bacterial pneumonia,
      pneumothorax, bronchial obstruction by mucus plugs and mild rhabdomyolysis. He
      was discharged from hospital 15 days after the bite with persistent limb weakness
      and urinary incontinence but eventually recovered. The interesting and unusual
      features of this case (severe local pain, very slow evolution of neurotoxic
      envenoming, persistent thrombocytopenia and mild coagulopathy) are discussed in
      the context of what is known of the composition of Micrurus venoms and the small 
      clinical literature on envenoming from their bites.

TI  - Low educational level: a risk factor for sexually transmitted infections among
      commercial sex workers in Quito, Ecuador.
PG  - 264-7
LID - 10.1258/ijsa.2007.007181 [doi]
AB  - Few studies have assessed the effect of educational level on sexually transmitted
      infections (STIs) and risk-taking behaviours among commercial sex workers (CSWs).
      This study analysed this association among female CSWs in Quito, Ecuador.
      Eighty-five CSWs were given a Spanish-language questionnaire on behaviours,
      socioeconomics and demographics. The correlation between years of education and
      number of prior STIs was calculated. Three groups of varying education level were
      formed and risk factors were analysed by Chi-square tests and analysis of
      variances. Lower educational level was associated with more STIs (r= -0.36;
      F=4.2; P=0.04), poorer knowledge of HIV/AIDS (P=0.03), earlier first prostitution
      (P=0.05) and first sex (P=0.00), willingness to engage in group sex (P=0.05) and 
      work on the street (P=0.02), and presence of non-paying sexual partners (P=0.05).
      CSWs with lower educational levels were disproportionately afflicted with STIs
      and participated in more high-risk behaviours. Low educational level may
      predispose CSWs to STIs and associated risk factors.

      female adolescents.
PG  - 136-45
LID - 10.1080/10640260801887261 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to study the proportion of Ecuadorian students
      fulfilling criteria on the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) in relation to
      socioeconomic status. Seven hundred and twenty three female adolescent
      participants recruited from Quito, Ecuador were administered a brief
      questionnaire consisting of the EAT-40 as well as lifestyle questions. Mean
      EAT-40 score was 17.12, with 14% fulfilling criteria. Lower socioeconomic status 
      and watching more television predicted higher scores; however BMI, age, and
      positive smoking status failed to correlate. The presently unvalidated Spanish
      version of the EAT-26 highly correlated with the validated EAT-40 (R=0.94). A
      higher than expected proportion of Ecuadorians are at risk for eating disorders, 
      especially among lower socioeconomic groups. The EAT-26 should be considered for 
      validation as a primary screening tool in Latin America.

TI  - Patterns of medicinal plant use: an examination of the Ecuadorian Shuar medicinal
      flora using contingency table and binomial analyses.
PG  - 422-30
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2007.12.006 [doi]
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Botanical pharmacopoeias are non-random subsets
      of floras, with some taxonomic groups over- or under-represented. Moerman
      [Moerman, D.E., 1979. Symbols and selectivity: a statistical analysis of Native
      American medical ethnobotany, Journal of Ethnopharmacology 1, 111-119] introduced
      linear regression/residual analysis to examine these patterns. However,
      regression, the commonly-employed analysis, suffers from several statistical
      flaws. AIM OF THE STUDY: We use contingency table and binomial analyses to
      examine patterns of Shuar medicinal plant use (from Amazonian Ecuador). MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: We first analyzed the Shuar data using Moerman's approach, modified 
      to better meet requirements of linear regression analysis. Second, we assessed
      the exact randomization contingency table test for goodness of fit. Third, we
      developed a binomial model to test for non-random selection of plants in
      individual families. RESULTS: Modified regression models (which accommodated
      assumptions of linear regression) reduced R(2) to from 0.59 to 0.38, but did not 
      eliminate all problems associated with regression analyses. Contingency table
      analyses revealed that the entire flora departs from the null model of equal
      proportions of medicinal plants in all families. In the binomial analysis, only
      10 angiosperm families (of 115) differed significantly from the null model. These
      10 families are largely responsible for patterns seen at higher taxonomic levels.
      CONCLUSIONS: Contingency table and binomial analyses offer an easy and
      statistically valid alternative to the regression approach.

TI  - Geographic differences in clinical characteristics and management of COPD: the
      EPOCA study.
PG  - 803-14
AB  - AIMS: Data on differences in clinical characteristics and management of COPD in
      different countries and settings are limited. We aimed to characterize the
      profile of patients with COPD in a number of countries and their treatment in
      order to evaluate adherence to recommendations of international guidelines.
      METHOD: This was an observational, international, cross-sectional study on
      patients with physician-diagnosed COPD. Demographic and clinical characteristics,
      risk factors, and treatment were collected by their physician via an internet
      web-based questionnaire developed for the study. RESULTS: A total of 77
      investigators from 17 countries provided data on 833 patients. The countries with
      the highest number of patients included were: Argentina (128), Ecuador (134),
      Spain (162), and Hong Kong (153). Overall, 79.3% were men and 81% former smokers,
      with a mean FEV1 = 42.7%, ranging from 34.3% in Hong Kong to 58.8% in Ecuador.
      Patients reported a mean of 1.6 exacerbations the previous year, with this
      frequency being significantly and negatively correlated with FEV1 (%) (r =
      -0.256; p < 0.0001). Treatment with short-acting bronchodilators and
      theophyllines was more frequent in Ecuador and Hong Kong compared with Spain and 
      Argentina, and in patients belonging to lower socioeconomic levels (p < 0.0001
      for all comparisons). Inadequacy of treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and
      theophyllines was high, with significant differences among countries.
      CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the clinical characteristics and management of COPD
      were significant across countries. Adherence to international guidelines appears 
      to be low. Efforts should be made to disseminate and adapt guidelines to the
      socioeconomic reality of different settings.

TI  - Low oxygen pressure as a driving factor for the altitudinal decline in taxon
      richness of stream macroinvertebrates.
PG  - 795-807
AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the altitudinal decrease in local
      richness of stream macroinvertebrates. I compared the explicatory power of a
      mid-domain effect (MDE) null model and a number of selected contemporary
      ecological variables, with a special emphasis on the altitude-mediated decrease
      in temperature and oxygen availability as possible driving factors for the
      observed pattern. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled at 30 stream sites
      between 2,600 and 4,000 m a.s.l. in northern Ecuador. All four measures of local 
      richness (total number of taxa, taxa in Surber samples, Fisher's alpha index and 
      rarefied richness) decreased with increasing altitude. The MDE null model, water 
      temperature and dissolved oxygen also decreased with altitude, while other
      measured variables were uncorrelated with altitude. Minimum oxygen saturation had
      the highest explanatory power of the density-corrected Fisher's alpha and
      rarefied richness (R = 0.48 and 0.52, respectively), but also minimum temperature
      (R = 0.48 and 0.41) and the MDE null model (R = 0.48 and 0.46) correlated
      significantly. Multiple regression analyses using several predictive variables
      showed that oxygen saturation had the greatest and only significant effect on
      density-corrected richness. The relationship between richness and oxygen
      corrected for the effect of altitude (using analyses of double residuals) was
      significant, whereas that of richness versus temperature was not. The results
      indicate that the decrease in richness with increasing altitude is mainly caused 
      by a decrease in oxygen saturation rather than by a decrease in temperature.
      Levels of oxygen saturation such as those found at high altitudes do not appear
      to be lethal to any species, but could affect macroinvertebrates through
      long-term, sub-lethal effects. I suggest that low oxygen availability may limit
      biodiversity at high altitudes not only in the aquatic, but also in the
      terrestrial environment.

TI  - Interference competition between introduced black rats and endemic Galapagos rice
      rats.
PG  - 2330-44
AB  - Replicated field experiments were used to quantify and to describe the mechanism 
      of competition between the introduced black rat Rattus rattus and the endemic
      Santiago rice rat Nesoryzomys swarthi on Santiago Island, Galapagos Islands,
      Ecuador. The removal of R. rattus significantly slowed the rate of seasonal
      population decline in N. swarthi. This effect was particularly evident for
      female, relative to male, N. swarthi and appeared to be driven solely by enhanced
      immigration; no other fitness or space use parameters were affected. The
      candidate hypotheses to explain the mechanism of competition were exploitation
      competition, interference by resource defense, and interference by aggressive
      encounter. To distinguish between hypotheses, we conducted a replicated resource 
      supplementation experiment with patchy food, scattered food, and no food
      (control) treatments. The opportunistic R. rattus responded to the extra
      resources with increased adult immigration and juvenile recruitment, resulting in
      a significant abundance boost of sevenfold on patchy grids and fourfold on
      scattered grids. Females increased in body mass, and the breeding season was
      lengthened. In contrast, there was no change in the abundance of N. swarthi and
      no obvious benefit to reproduction. Instead, the costs of interference apparently
      outweighed the benefits of extra food: female N. swarthi increased in mass with
      supplementary food, but female (relative to male) immigration and residency were 
      repressed on all supplemented areas. This response supported the hypothesis of
      interference by aggressive encounter, and we were able to rule out the
      alternative hypotheses. Although periodic population crashes of R. rattus on the 
      arid north coast of Santiago may ameliorate its competitive impact, climate
      change may tip the balance. Control or eradication of R. rattus should improve
      future survival prospects for N. swarthi, but wildlife managers must be prepared 
      for the potential eruption of the introduced house mouse Mus musculus, because
      this species experienced a release from interference competition and immigrated
      to removal areas.

TI  - Comparative analysis of zinc protoporphyrin and blood lead levels in lead-exposed
      Andean children.
PG  - 787-92
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the zinc
      protoporphyrin/heme ratio (ZPP/heme) as a biomarker for chronic lead (Pb)
      poisoning in children with a history of high Pb exposure. DESIGN AND METHODS:
      ZPP/heme ratio was measured in blood samples from 78 children (44 females and 34 
      males) with persistent Pb exposure from Pb glazing of ceramics in a local cottage
      industry in the Andes Mountains of Ecuador. RESULTS: Mean blood lead (PbB) level 
      was 26.4 microg/dL (SD: 23.2; range: 4.0-107.0), and the mean ZPP/heme ratio was 
      152.4 micromol/mol (SD: 190.6; range: 36.0-1064.0). A regression analysis of PbB 
      level and ZPP/heme ratio revealed a significant association (r=0.761, p=
      <0.0001), with the logZPP showing a higher correlation with PbB (r=0.869, p=
      <0.0001). The ZZP/heme ratio decreased significantly with increasing age (ANOVA, 
      p=0.030). The mean ZPP/heme ratios for females and males were 139.6 and 169.0
      micromol/mol, respectively, and were not statistically different (t-test,
      p=0.504). CONCLUSION: The elevated ZPP/heme ratios, coupled with high PbB levels 
      observed in this cohort of Andean children of Pb-glazing workers, suggest chronic
      Pb intoxication and probable iron deficiency.

TI  - Cox regression was used to compare the measurement error of two tests vs. a gold 
      standard.
PG  - 345-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of survival analysis has been proposed to compare the
      diagnostic performance of two tests. We expanded it to compare two tests with a
      gold standard simultaneously. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In this diagnostic study,
      the spherical equivalent component of refraction was measured with the
      PowerRefractor and the Canon R-50 autorefractor. The reference test was Canon
      R-50 autorefraction with cycloplegic blockage of accommodation. The error of the 
      two index tests was compared with Cox regression analysis with robust standard
      error estimation to take into account repeated measures on the same subject. We
      evaluated 1,559 children aged 5-6 from 25 schools in three urban locations in
      Ecuador. RESULTS: The main strength of survival analysis was that it does not
      assume a specific distribution of measurement errors, which were not normally
      distributed in this study. The proportional hazards assumption, a requirement of 
      Cox regression, was met only after removal of the bias of each test. When this
      was done, noncycloplegic autorefraction was better than the PowerRefractor
      regardless of the magnitude and direction of the error. CONCLUSION: The potential
      of Cox regression can be applied to diagnostic studies that compare more tests
      with a gold standard.

TI  - Determination of the threshold odor concentration of main odorants in essential
      oils using gas chromatography-olfactometry incremental dilution technique.
PG  - 131-5
AB  - An essential oil, obtained by steam distillation of Clinopodium tomentosum
      (Kunth) Govaerts (Lamiaceae), collected in Ecuador, was analyzed by gas
      chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and GC-MS techniques. To our knowledge, the
      composition of this essential oil is described here for the first time, both from
      the chemical and olfactometric viewpoints. A preliminary analysis by GC-MS and
      using Kovats' retention indexes, lead to characterize and quantify the oil
      constituents, while GC-O was then applied for the identification of the main
      odorants. By the incremental dilution method (AEDA, CHARM Analysis), applied to
      the GC-O technique, the flavor dilution (FD) chromatogram was obtained. In order 
      to calculate the TOC values of the main odorants, the relationship between the
      odorant concentration at the sniffing port and that one in the injected solution 
      was established. This relationship was calculated by comparing the injected
      amount with the TOC value of a reference compound (limonene), obtained by dynamic
      dilution olfactometry. A good agreement was found between calculated and measured
      TOC values of few odorants.

TI  - Infection by trypanosomes in marsupials and rodents associated with human
      dwellings in Ecuador.
PG  - 1251-5
AB  - Small mammals trapped in domestic and peridomestic environments of rural Ecuador 
      were screened for trypanosome infection by direct microscopy and hemoculture.
      Identification of species of trypanosomes was then performed by morphological
      characteristics and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Of 194 animals
      collected, 15 were positive for infection (7.73%). Eight (4.12%) were infected
      with Trypanosoma cruzi (1 of 33 Didelphis marsupialis; 7 of 61 Rattus rattus).
      Eleven R. rattus (18.03%) harbored T. lewisi, 5 of which presented mixed
      infections with T. cruzi. Additionally, 1 of 3 Oryzomys xanthaeolus was infected 
      with T. rangeli. No trypanosome infection was detected in Philander opossum (n = 
      1), Mus musculus (n = 79), Rattus norvegicus (n = 8), Akodon orophilus (n = 4),
      Sigmodon peruanus (n = 3), or Proechimys decumanus (n = 2). Many of the isolates 
      belong to T. cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, and R. rattus had the 
      highest prevalence. Because of its abundance in the study areas, this species is 
      considered an important reservoir for Chagas disease. This is the first report of
      T. lewisi and T. rangeli in Ecuador. This study is also the first to describe
      natural mixed infections of T. cruzi-T. lewisi.

TI  - PowerRefractor versus Canon R-50 Autorefraction to assess refractive error in
      children: a community-based study in ecuador.
PG  - 144-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the agreement of the PowerRefractor with Canon R-50
      autorefraction for measuring refractive error in a community of Ecuadorian
      children. METHODS: We examined 1564 children aged 5 to 6 years from two
      ethnically and geographically similar regions of the Ecuadorian highlands.
      Results of a refraction obtained without cycloplegia with the PowerRefractor and 
      with the Canon R-50 autorefractor (NCAR) were compared with the gold-standard
      examination, cycloplegic autorefraction (CAR) with the Canon R-50 autorefractor. 
      Power vectors were used to analyze refractive error. Bland-Altman limits of
      agreement were obtained. RESULTS: Although the mean difference in the spherical
      equivalent refractive error between the PowerRefractor and CAR was small (-0.03 D
      +/- 0.05 D), the 95% limits of agreement were wide (+/-2.03 D). On the other
      hand, NCAR showed a greater bias (0.97 D +/- 0.04 D) and smaller limits of
      agreement (+/-1.49 D). The limits of agreement of the PowerRefractor were also
      wider than NCAR for measuring astigmatism. When the mean difference was
      stratified by the subgroups of refractive error vectors, the PowerRefractor was
      found to have poorer limits of agreement than NCAR for hyperopic defects.
      CONCLUSION: The PowerRefractor is accurate, but not as precise for measuring
      refractive error as compared to the Canon R-50 autorefractor, especially for high
      hyperopia.

TI  - Neurocognitive screening of mercury-exposed children of Andean gold miners.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - Performance on Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) test of
      visual-spatial reasoning was used to evaluate the effects of mercury (Hg)
      exposure on 73 Andean children aged 5 to 11 years (mean: 8.4) living in the
      Nambija and Portovelo gold mining areas of Ecuador, where Hg is widely used in
      amalgamation. Mean levels of Hg found in blood (Hg(B)), urine (Hg(U)), and hair
      (Hg(H)) samples were 5.1 microg/L (SD: 2.4; range: 1-10 microg/L), 13.3 microg/L 
      (SD: 25.9; range: 1-166 microg/L), and 8.5 microg/g (SD: 22.8; range: 1-135
      microg/g), respectively. Of the children in the Nambija area 67-84.9% had
      abnormal RCPM standard scores (i.e., < or = 25%tile), depending on the test norm 
      used in the data analysis. Higher standard scores for Peruvian (t = 4.77; p = <
      0.0001) and Puerto Rican (t = 4.51; p = < 0.0001) norms than for U.S. norms
      suggested a linguistic influence. No difference was found between Peruvian and
      Puerto Rican norms (t = 0.832; p = < 0.408), which showed a significant positive 
      correlation (r = 0.915, p = < 0.0001). Children with abnormal Hg(B) and Hg(H)
      levels had significantly lower scores on the RCPM subtest B than did children
      with nontoxic Hg levels (t = -2.16; p = < 0.034). These results suggest that a
      substantial number of Hg-exposed children in the Nambija study area have
      neurocognitive deficits in visual-spatial reasoning.

TI  - Rostraureum tropicale gen. sp. nov. (Diaporthales) associated with dying
      Terminalia ivorensis in Ecuador.
PG  - 1029-44
AB  - Terminalia ivorensis, a tree of central African origin, is planted in several
      tropical countries for timber and veneer production. During the course of a
      recent disease survey, an unknown fungus was found associated with basal cankers 
      on dying T. ivorensis in Ecuador. The fungus has orange fruiting structures and
      septate, fusoid ascospores, similar to those of Cryphonectria, a well-known genus
      of canker pathogens. The aim of this study was to identify the fungus and to
      assess its pathogenicity. Identification was based on morphological
      characteristics as well as DNA sequence data. DNA sequence data from the ITS
      regions of the rDNA operon and two regions of the beta-tubulin gene, were
      compared with published sequences of Cryphonectria species and the closely
      related genera Endothia and Chrysoporthe. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on
      T. superba saplings. Morphological characterisations revealed that the
      conidiomata of the fungus from T. ivorensis, differed from those typical of
      Cryphonectria in being superficial and rostrate. Only Cryphonectria longirostris 
      was similar to the fungus from T. ivorensis, but could be distinguished from it
      based on conidial size. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the fungus from T.
      ivorensis grouped closely with species of Cryphonectria, Chrysoporthe and
      Endothia, yet formed a distinct clade. Pathogenicity tests on T. superba provided
      evidence that the fungus is able to cause distinct stem cankers. We conclude that
      the pathogenic fungus from T. ivorensis represents a new genus and new species in
      the Diaporthales and we provide the name Rostraureum tropicale for it. The genus 
      is typified by R. tropicale. Furthermore, C. longirostris is transferred to
      Rostraureum.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for protozoan and nematode infections among children 
      in an Ecuadorian highland community.
PG  - 585-92
AB  - In order to create a parasite prevention program for Santa Ana, Ecuador, we
      worked with local physicians to identify the prevalence and risk factors for
      intestinal parasitic infection among children. Two hundred households were
      randomly selected and asked to submit three stool samples from a selected child. 
      Information from direct observation and questionnaires was used to determine
      environmental and behavioral risk factors for parasitic infection. Prevalence of 
      any parasitic infection was 65.6% of the 189 children who submitted fecal
      samples. Parasitic infections included Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar (46.6%),
      Giardia lamblia (18.5%) and Ascaris lumbricoides (20.1%). In a multivariate
      logistic model, risk factors (P<0.05) for E. histolytica/E. dispar included >1
      month since antiparasitic treatment, not adding chlorine to drinking water,
      children not washing their hands before eating, and having a fewer number of
      electrical appliances in the home. The risk factor identified for G. lamblia was 
      children not washing their hands before eating. Risk factors for A. lumbricoides 
      included >6 months since antiparasitic treatment and having a fewer number of
      electrical appliances in the home. This study may have implications for other
      communities throughout the developing world.

TI  - Mercury levels in urine and hair of children in an Andean gold-mining settlement.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - This field study investigated mercury (Hg) levels in urine and hair of Andean
      children of indigenous Saraguro and Metizo gold miners in the Nambija, Ecuador
      gold mining settlement. Spot samples of urine and hair samples were collected
      concurrently from 80 children each. Urine samples were used to determine the
      inorganic Hg burden, while hair samples were used as an index of methylmercury
      (MeHg) exposure from consumption of Hg contaminated fish. The mean level of Hg in
      urine (HgU) was 10.9 microg/L, and the mean level in hair (HgH) was 6.0 microg/g.
      Regression analysis showed a significant association (r = 0.404, p = 0.0007)
      between matched HgU and HgH samples. Mean HgU and HgU levels tended to be higher 
      for children aged 6-14 years than for a younger group. The wide range of Hg
      levels in the urine and hair of Andean children of gold miners may place them at 
      risk for neurodevelopmental and learning disorders.

TI  - Ambulatory diagnoses-cluster statistics of patient visits at a clinic in the
      Amazon Region of Ecuador.
PG  - 103
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mondana Clinic is a small rural clinic located in the Napo river
      region of the Amazon basin in Ecuador. Since its opening in 1997 the clinic has
      grown to be the primary health care facility for approximately 3000 individuals. 
      METHODS: A retrospective study was performed tabulating the ambulatory diagnosis,
      age, sex, and domicile of patients over a 9 month period in 1999. RESULTS: During
      the study period there were 765 patient visits that resulted in at least one
      diagnosis. Of the patient visits, 175 (22.8%) resulted in multiple diagnoses.
      Women accounted for 58% of the patient visits, which is similar to the 60% of
      ambulatory patient visits made in the USA by women. The age distribution showed
      66% of patients were under 25 years of age. When comparing diagnoses of males
      with females, several differences were noted. As expected, urinary tract
      infections were approximately four-fold more common in females than in males.
      Gastritis and headaches were also more common reasons for patient visits in the
      female population than in the male. Conversely, lacerations, abrasions, and
      contusions ranked higher in the male than in the female population for patient
      visits. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to provide public health information 
      for this region that will prove useful to the health professionals and funding
      agencies working in the region. Furthermore, it provides a baseline for
      comparison with other regions in Ecuador and South America in general, as well as
      comparisons with data-rich countries such as the USA.

TI  - High household infestation rates by synanthropic vectors of Chagas disease in
      southern Ecuador.
PG  - 68-74
AB  - Entomological surveys were conducted in five rural communities (138 domiciliary
      units [DUs]) in the southern Andes of Ecuador. Adobe walls and ceramic tile roofs
      were predominant construction materials. A 35% house infestation rate with
      Panstrongylus chinai (Del Ponte, 1929) (0.7%), Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus
      (Champion, 1899) (0.7%), Rhodnius ecuadoriensis (Lent & Leon, 1958) (27%), and/or
      Triatoma carrioni (Larrousse, 1926) (7%) was found. Adults and nymphs of R.
      ecuadoriensis and T. carrioni were found in intradomiciliary and peridomiciliary 
      areas. Breeding triatomine colonies were present in 85% of infested DUs, and the 
      average insect crowding was 52+/-113 triatomine bugs per infested house. T.
      cruzi-like organisms were found by microscopic examination in the feces or
      hindgut but not the salivary glands of 4% of examined R. ecuadoriensis and 12% T.
      carrioni. Serological tests detected a general anti-T. cruzi antibody
      seroprevalence of 3.9% (n = 1136). Only 2% of individuals had heard of Chagas
      disease, and although triatomines were reported as a major nuisance by the
      population they were not considered vectors of disease. Additional baseline field
      research is needed for the design and implementation of a Chagas disease control 
      program in the region.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation in biting rates and parasite transmission
      potentials of onchocerciasis vectors in Ecuador.
PG  - 178-95
AB  - The influence of spatial and temporal factors on onchocerciasis transmission by
      Simulium exiguum s.l. and S. quadrivittatum in Ecuador was investigated to help
      develop sampling protocols for entomological surveillance of ivermectin
      programmes. Flies were collected in alternate months (November 1995-November
      1996) at four sites each in the hyperendemic communities of San Miguel and El
      Tigre. A fixed-effects analysis of variance was used to explore the influence on 
      vector abundance of locality, site, month and hour. Infectivity rates detected by
      dissection and PCR assays were compared. Simulium exiguum s.l. predominated at El
      Tigre (75%) whereas S. quadrivittatum prevailed at San Miguel (62%). Vector
      abundance was highest on river banks and outside houses. Biting and infection
      rates peaked from March to July. Hourly activity patterns were bimodal in S.
      exiguum but unimodal in S. quadrivittatum. Annual transmission potentials (ATP)
      for both species combined were 385 and 733 third stage larvae/person in San
      Miguel and El Tigre respectively, with S. exiguum accounting for 80% of the
      combined ATP at both localities. We recommend protocols that may maximize
      detection of parasite transmission. Infection rates thus obtained must be linked 
      with vector density estimates to assess meaningfully host exposure as treatment
      progresses.

TI  - [The real philanthropic expedition of the smallpox vaccine: monarchy and
      modernity in 1803].
PG  - 223-31
AB  - Smallpox resulted in the death of 30 % of those who acquired it, so the
      preventive method discovered by Edward Jenner (London, 1798) spread very quickly.
      At the request in 1803 of Carlos IV, king of Spain, his government evaluated
      offers to carry smallpox vaccine to the colonies. The selected proposal, by
      doctor Francisco Xavier de Balmis, sought to take the lymph to America and Asia
      in a chain of arm to arm vaccination of foundlings. The Expedition set sail from 
      Corunna on November 30, 1803, stopped in the Canary Isles, Puerto Rico, and
      Venezuela and after Caracas (1804) split in two groups. Balmis led some members
      of the Expedition to Cuba and Mexico. For the trip to the Philippines, in 1805,
      parents lent their children in exchange for economic compensation and the promise
      that the boys would be returned home. The Expedition returned to Mexico in
      August, 1807, but Balmis separately took vaccine to China and returned to Spain. 
      Another contingent of the Expedition, under vice-director Jose Salvany, took
      vaccine to what we know as Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. His assistant
      Manuel Grajales reached the Chilean Patagonia in 1811. This article also comments
      on three principal themes - the institutional management of the scientific
      project, the conflicts that characterized its course, and the children's
      experience. The Vaccine Expedition was a brave and humanitarian endeavor, but
      also an extraordinary sanitary and administrative success. It was not until the
      twentieth century that a global eradication campaign eliminated smallpox in the
      world.

TI  - The role of immigrants in the assembly of the South American rainforest tree
      flora.
PG  - 1611-22
AB  - The Amazon lowland rainforest flora is conventionally viewed as comprising
      lineages that evolved in biogeographic isolation after the split of west Gondwana
      (ca. 100 Myr ago). Recent molecular phylogenies, however, identify immigrant
      lineages that arrived in South America during its period of oceanic isolation
      (ca. 100-3 Myr ago). Long-distance sweepstakes dispersal across oceans played an 
      important and possibly predominant role. Stepping-stone migration from Africa and
      North America through hypothesized Late Cretaceous and Tertiary island chains may
      have facilitated immigration. An analysis of inventory plot data suggests that
      immigrant lineages comprise ca. 20% of both the species and individuals of an
      Amazon tree community in Ecuador. This is more than an order of magnitude higher 
      than previous estimates. We also present data on the community-level similarity
      between South American and palaeotropical rainforests, and suggest that most
      taxonomic similarity derives from trans-oceanic dispersal, rather than a shared
      Gondwanan history.

TI  - Analysis of Rhizobium etli and of its symbiosis with wild Phaseolus vulgaris
      supports coevolution in centers of host diversification.
PG  - 13548-53
AB  - Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) comprise three major geographic genetic pools, 
      one in Mexico, Central America, and Colombia, another in the southern Andes, and 
      a third in Ecuador and northern Peru. Species Rhizobium etli is the predominant
      rhizobia found symbiotically associated with beans in the Americas. We have found
      polymorphism in the common nodulation gene nodC among R. etli strains from a wide
      range of geographical origins, which disclosed three nodC types. The different
      nodC alleles in American strains show varying predominance in their regional
      distributions in correlation with the centers of bean genetic diversification (BD
      centers). By cross-inoculating wild common beans from the three BD centers with
      soils from Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Northwestern Argentina, the R. etli
      populations from nodules originated from Mexican soil again showed allele
      predominance that was opposite to those originated from Bolivian and Argentinean 
      soil, whereas populations from Ecuadorian soil were intermediate. These results
      also indicated that the preferential nodulation of beans by geographically
      related R. etli lineages was independent of the nodulating environment.
      Coinoculation of wild common beans from each of the three BD centers with an
      equicellular mixture of R. etli strains representative of the Mesoamerican and
      southern Andean lineages revealed a host-dependent distinct competitiveness:
      beans from the Mesoamerican genetic pool were almost exclusively nodulated by
      strains from their host region, whereas nodules of beans from the southern Andes 
      were largely occupied by the geographically cognate R. etli lineages. These
      results suggest coevolution in the centers of host genetic diversification.

TI  - Geohelminth infections protect against severe inflammatory diarrhoea in children.
PG  - 519-21
AB  - We investigated the risk of severe inflammatory diarrhoea associated with
      geohelminth parasites in 1746 children attending a rural hospital in Ecuador from
      December 2000 to July 2002. Infections with geohelminths were strongly protective
      against the risk of severe inflammatory diarrhoea. Our findings suggest that
      geohelminth infections have important protective effects against enteroinvasive
      infections in young children.

TI  - Relationship between bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination, Mantoux test
      positivity, and geohelminth infection.
PG  - 473-6
AB  - To investigate the potential protective effects of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) 
      vaccination scar and sensitization to tuberculin against geohelminth infections, 
      we conducted a cross-sectional study among school age children in rural
      communities in Pichincha Province in Ecuador where BCG vaccination is routinely
      given at birth. A total of 944 children aged 8-14 years were evaluated for the
      presence of BCG scars and sensitization to tuberculin, and underwent faecal
      examination for geohelminth parasites. BCG scars were present in 88.2% of
      children and positive Mantoux tests were observed in 19.1% of children.
      Geohelminth prevalence was high with 70.3% infected with any parasite, 52.1% with
      Ascaris lumbricoides, 52.3% with Trichuris trichiura, 7.6% with Ancylostoma
      duodenale, and 3.0% with Strongyloides stercoralis. In multivariate analyses, the
      presence of BCG vaccine scars was not significantly associated with infections
      with any geohelminth parasite (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.74, 95% CI
      0.43-1.28, P = 0.28), but an inverse association was observed for infections with
      S. stercoralis that was of borderline statistical significance (AOR = 0.38, 95%
      CI 0.15-1.00, P = 0.05). There were no associations between sensitization to
      tuberculin and infection with geohelminth parasites. The data provide little
      support for an important protective role of neonatal BCG vaccination or current
      mycobacterial sensitization against geohelminth infections.

TI  - Age, temperature, and parasitaemia predict chloroquine treatment failure and
      anaemia in children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
PG  - 422-8
AB  - The prevalence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been
      increasing in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America over the last 2
      decades, and has been associated with increased anaemia-associated morbidity and 
      higher mortality rates. Prospectively collected clinical and parasitological data
      from a multicentre study of 788 children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated P.
      falciparum malaria were analysed in order to identify risk factors for
      chloroquine treatment failure and to assess its impact on anaemia after therapy. 
      The proportion of chloroquine treatment failures (combined early and late
      treatment failures) was higher in the central-eastern African countries
      (Tanzania, 53%; Uganda, 80%; Zambia, 57%) and Ecuador (54%) than in Ghana (36%). 
      Using logistic regression, predictors of early treatment failure included younger
      age, higher baseline temperature, and greater levels of parasitaemia. We conclude
      that younger age, higher initial temperature, and higher baseline parasitaemia
      predict early treatment failure and a higher probability of worsening anaemia
      between admission and days 7 or 14 post-treatment.

TI  - [Tuberculosis infection and disease in immigrant children].
PG  - 86-92
AB  - From the second half of the eighties, the cases of tuberculosis (TBC) in Italy
      have been constantly increasing. The increase in TBC cases in developed countries
      is related to different factors, including HIV epidemic and increased number of
      immigrants from countries with high TBC incidence and important socio-economic
      problems. Compared with adults few children with TBC were homeless or coinfected 
      with HIV, nonetheless the children lived frequently in low socioeconomic status
      and consequently high risk of being uninsured and with adults at risk for
      tuberculosis (immediate relative, household members, or recently immigrated). An 
      epidemiologic study was carried out, in order to evaluate the impact of TBC
      infection in immigrant children. From January 2001 to December 2002, Mantoux test
      (5 IU) was performed in immigrant children hospitalized or followed in two
      children hospitals. They included 228 children: mean age 4 years (range 1 month
      to 15 years). The patients came from: South America (44%) (especially from
      Ecuador), from Africa (20%), from Eastern Europe (19%), (especially from Middle
      East and North Africa), from Far East (17%). In 30 cases (13,2%) Mantoux test was
      positive. Among these latter, 21 presented latent infection, whereas another 9
      had tuberculous disease with pulmonary localization and one of them associated
      with cervical adenopathy. In the study period, among all children (4426) admitted
      the two Units, the prevalence of tuberculous disease was 2,5% in immigrant
      children compared 0.2% in native children. Accurate epidemiologic monitoring,
      further clinical studies aimed at highlighting TBC peculiar aspects in children, 
      and adequate therapy can lead to TBC control in the immigrant children.

TI  - Bioassay screening of Amazonian plants.
PG  - 291-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate several biological
      activities of thirty plant extracts collected in the North West Amazon (Ecuador).
      Some of these plants are being used for their reputed medicinal properties by the
      natives of this region. METHODS: Five in vitro bioassays were used to screen the 
      plant material. 1. The brine shrimp lethality examination (BSLT) in microplate is
      a general test that seems capable of detecting a broad spectrum of bioactivity
      present in crude plant extracts. 2. Free radical scavenging properties were
      studied in a colorimetric assay using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). 3.
      The beta-glucosidase inhibition test is thought to be a method for the evaluation
      of anti-AIDS, anti-diabetic or anti-obesity compounds. 4. The xanthine oxidase
      inhibition assay is used to identify potential anti-gout agents. 5. The
      antibacterial activity that is being used to isolate and identify antibiotic
      drugs. RESULTS: In the BSLT, we found that Piscidia carthagenensis demonstrated
      very good activity with a LC50: 21.81 micrograms/mL. It is considered that plant 
      extracts with low LC50 values may contain metabolites with cytotoxic, antifungal,
      insecticidal or pesticide activities. In the antioxidant activity bioassay,
      several plant extracts were confirmed to have excellent free radical scavenging
      properties. Rhus juglandifolia and Clusia venusta leaves exhibited an ED50: 3.12 
      micrograms/mL and 3.61 micrograms/mL, respectively. Piper reticulatum (84%), Inga
      heteroptera (77%), Clusia venusta (70.9%), and Rhus juglandifolia (70.5%) showed 
      fairly good inhibition activity for beta-glucosidase. On the other hand, none of 
      the plant extracts was capable of inhibiting xanthine oxidase. Finally, the
      Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium diphteriae
      were found to be sensitive to the majority of the plant extracts, whereas the
      Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus
      vulgaris, and Salmonella typhi were proved to be resistant toward the plant
      extracts. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to continue investigating our plant
      kingdom, especially the world tropical reserves as an alternative for finding new
      or better drugs. It should be essential to follow-up this type of investigation
      to isolate and elucidate the active principles of the bio-positive plants.

PG  - 79-93
AB  - Eugenio Espejo (1747-1795). Mestizo. Was born in the Royal Audience of Quito.
      Today, the Republic of Ecuador. The 18th century was isf illustration and
      enlightment for the Quitenos. Espejo's extraordinary erudition is explained by
      the full access he had to yhe libraries created in Quito by the Jesuits. The best
      in the continent at that time. His work, Reflections on Smallpox, makes or Espejo
      outstanding in his field. Pioneer in bacteriology and of the biopathological
      observations in America. The first newspaper in Quito, Primicies of the culture
      of Quito, was his own work. Furthermore, Espejo is considered the precursor of
      the independence of Hispanoamerica.

TI  - New data on the world distribution of paraoxonase (PON1 Gln 192 --> Arg) gene
      frequencies.
PG  - 365-73
AB  - The physiological role of human paraoxonase (PON), a serum enzyme that hydrolyzes
      organophosphate insecticides and nerve agents, is not clear. Of the three genes
      in the paraoxonase gene family, PON1 shows a polymorphism, Gln 192 --> Arg,
      governed by two common alleles named *Q and *R. These determine two different
      isoforms associated, respectively, with lower and higher activity towards
      paraoxon, a toxic metabolic product of the insecticide parathion. The *R allele
      has often been found associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease.
      As human populations tend towards greater exposure to environmental changes,
      including changes in dietary habits and contact with insecticides or other toxic 
      substances, health risks will change as well. In studying the prevention of these
      newly emerging risks, it could be important to know the distribution of the two
      alleles in the various world populations. In this paper we report on the genotype
      and allele frequencies of this polymorphism in different populations, most of
      which have never been examined for this polymorphism. Samples were taken from
      mainland Italy, Sardinia, Ethiopia, Benin, and Ecuador. The *R allele frequencies
      for the samples were: 0.313, 0.248, 0.408, 0.612, and 0.789, respectively. The
      data show a large variability in allele frequencies, and, in particular, that
      PON1 allele distribution depends on membership to different geographic
      populations.

TI  - Trypanosoma cruzi isoenzyme variability in Ecuador: first observation of zymodeme
      III genotypes in chronic chagasic patients.
PG  - 378-82
AB  - We have analysed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) at 21 genetic loci
      10 Trypanosoma cruzi stocks isolated from chronic chagasic patients and 3 stocks 
      isolated from Triatoma dimidiata collected in human habitats from the coastal
      part of Ecuador (all stocks isolated in August-December 1998). Isoenzyme profiles
      were compared to those of 4 laboratory-cloned stocks representing the major
      phylogenetic subdivisions of T. cruzi. This parasite's genetic variability in
      Ecuador proved to be considerable, even in this limited sample, since all main
      isoenzyme genotypes were recorded. Four stocks from patients were identical at
      all loci to the reference stock MNcl2 ('major clonet #39'; T. cruzi II) isolated 
      in Chile. The 3 stocks isolated from T. dimidiata were closely related to the
      formerly described zymodeme I (T. cruzi I). Finally, 3 stocks from chronic
      chagasic patients (one with an asymptomatic form, 2 with a cardiac-digestive
      form) were closely related to the formerly described zymodeme III (presently not 
      classified in either T. cruzi I or T. cruzi II). This is the first observation of
      this category of T. cruzi genotypes in chronic chagasic patients. In the past it 
      was recorded only in acute patients, wild mammals and wild triatomine bugs. The
      epidemiological implications of these results are discussed.

TI  - Differential characteristics in the chemical composition of bananas from Tenerife
      (Canary Islands) and Ecuador.
PG  - 7586-92
AB  - The contents of moisture, protein, ash, ascorbic acid, glucose, fructose, total
      sugars, and total and insoluble fiber were determined in cultivars of bananas
      (Gran Enana and Pequena Enana) harvested in Tenerife and in bananas (Gran Enana) 
      from Ecuador. The chemical compositions in the bananas from Tenerife and from
      Ecuador were clearly different. The cultivar did not influence the chemical
      composition, except for insoluble fiber content. Variations of the chemical
      composition were observed in the bananas from Tenerife according to cultivation
      method (greenhouse and outdoors), farming style (conventional and organic), and
      region of production (north and south). A highly significant (r = 0.995)
      correlation between glucose and fructose was observed. Correlations of ash and
      protein contents tend to separate the banana samples according to origin. A
      higher content of protein, ash, and ascorbic acid was observed as the length of
      the banana decreased. Applying factor analysis, the bananas from Ecuador were
      well separated from the bananas produced in Tenerife. An almost total
      differentiation (91.7%) between bananas from Tenerife and bananas from Ecuador
      was obtained by selecting protein, ash, and ascorbic acid content and applying
      stepwise discriminant analysis. By selecting the bananas Pequena Enana and using 
      discriminant analysis, a clear separation of the samples according to the region 
      of production and farming style was observed.

TI  - Cytogenetic monitoring in a population occupationally exposed to pesticides in
      Ecuador.
PG  - 1077-80
AB  - We analyzed the incidence of structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations
      (CAs) in workers of a plantation of flowers located in Quito, Ecuador, in South
      America. This study included 41 individuals occupationally exposed to 27
      pesticides, some of which are restricted in many countries and are classified as 
      extremely toxic by the World Health Organization; among these are aldicarb and
      fenamiphos. The same number of individuals of the same age, sex, and geographic
      area were selected as controls. Workers exposed to these pesticides showed an
      increased frequency of CA compared with control group (20.59% vs. 2.73%; p <
      0.001). We conclude that screening for CA is an adequate biomarker for evaluating
      and detecting genotoxicity resulting from exposure to pesticides. Levels of
      erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase were also determined as a complementary
      metabolic study. Levels below the optimal (> 28 U/mL blood) were found in 88% of 
      exposed individuals; this clearly shows the effect of organophosphate pesticides.
      When comparing the levels of acetylcholinesterase and structural CA frequencies, 
      there was a negative linear correlation (r = 0.416; p < 0.01). We conclude that
      by using both analyses it may be possible to estimate damage produced by exposure
      to organophosphate pesticides.

TI  - Observations on the domestic ecology of Rhodnius ecuadoriensis (Triatominae).
PG  - 199-202
AB  - Rhodnius ecuadoriensis infests peridomiciles and colonises houses in rural
      southern Ecuador. Six out of 84 dwellings (7%) surveyed in a rural village were
      infested (78 bugs/infested domicile; 279 bugs were collected in a single
      dwelling). Precipitin tests revealed R. ecuadoriensis fed on birds (65%), rodents
      (31%), marsupials (8%), and humans (15%) - mixed bloodmeals detected in 37.5% of 
      individual samples. Trypanosoma cruzi from opossums and rodents may thus be
      introduced into the domestic cycle. Wasp parasitoidism was detected in 6.5% of
      995 R. ecuadoriensis eggs (only in peridomestic habitats). Control strategies
      should integrate insecticide spraying (indoors and peridomestic), better
      management of poultry, and housing improvements. A possible inefficacy of
      Malathion is reported.

TI  - A taxonomic reevaluation of Phrynops (Testudines: Chelidae) with the description 
      of two new genera and a new species of Batrachemys.
PG  - 715-64
AB  - Relationships among turtle species loosely categorized within the South American 
      genus Phrynops are explored. Three once recognized genera (Batrachemys,
      Mesoclemmys and Phrynops) that were demoted to subgenera, and then synonymized
      with Phrynops, are demonstrated to warrant full recognition based on morphometric
      analysis, skull osteology, and mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequencing.
      Mesoclemmys is resurrected from the synonymy of Phrynops as a monotypic genus
      including M. gibba. The genus Rhinemys, previously a synonym of Phrynops, is
      resurrected for the species R. rufipes. Ranacephala gen. nov. is described to
      include the species R. hogei. The genus Batrachemys is resurrected from the
      synonymy of Phrynops and includes B. dahli, B. nasuta, B. raniceps, B.
      tuberculata, and B. zuliae. The taxon vanderhaegei is placed in Bufocephala gen. 
      nov. The genus Phrynops is redefined to include the taxa P. geoffroanus, P.
      hilarii, P. tuberosus, and P. williamsi. Cladistic analysis of morphological data
      supports this taxonomy. A new species of Batrachemys is described from the
      western Amazon region, and is distinguished by having facial markings in
      juveniles, a relatively wide head, and a flattened shell. The new species, B.
      heliostemma sp. nov., is sympatric with and most similar to the recently
      resurrected form Batrachemys raniceps in the upper Amazonian region of Peru and
      adjacent Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia. Lastly, morphometric data from
      living and museum specimens of all species of Batrachemys are presented.

TI  - Biogeography of Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in Ecuador: implications for 
      the design of control strategies.
PG  - 611-20
AB  - Chagas disease control strategies strongly depend on the triatomine vector
      species involved in Trypanosoma cruzi transmission within each area. Here we
      report the results of the identification of specimens belonging to various
      species of Triatominae captured in Ecuador (15 species from 17 provinces) and
      deposited in the entomological collections of the Catholic University of Ecuador 
      (Quito), Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (Brazil), the Natural History Museum London (UK),
      the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (UK), the National Institute
      of Hygiene (Quito), and the Vozandes Hospital (Quito). A critical review of
      published information and new field records are presented. We analysed these data
      in relation to the life zones where triatomines occur (11 life zones, excluding
      those over 2,200 m altitude), and provide biogeographical maps for each species. 
      These records are discussed in terms of epidemiological significance and design
      of control strategies. Findings relevant to the control of the main vector
      species are emphasised. Different lines of evidence suggest that Triatoma
      dimidiata is not native to Ecuador-Peru, and that synanthropic populations of
      Rhodnius ecuadoriensis in southern Ecuador-northern Peru might be isolated from
      their sylvatic conspecifics. Local eradication of T. dimidiata and these R.
      ecuadoriensis populations might therefore be attainable. However, the presence of
      a wide variety of native species indicates the necessity for a strong
      longitudinal surveillance system.

TI  - An outbreak of plague including cases with probable pneumonic infection, Ecuador,
      1998.
PG  - 387-91
AB  - During February and March of 1998, 12 sudden deaths were reported among residents
      of a high-Andean community in Ecuador. All 12 fatalities were members of the same
      extended family and some had apparent exposure to sick guinea-pigs. Following an 
      initial investigation by public health officials, an additional death was
      reported in a nearby community in April, also associated with exposure to sick
      guinea-pigs. Blood samples from humans, dogs, and a rodent were tested for
      antibody to the F1 antigen of Yersinia pestis by passive haemagglutination assay.
      Tissue from rodents was subjected to direct fluorescent antibody staining using
      fluorescein-labelled monoclonal antibody to Y. pestis F1 antigen. Formalin-fixed 
      specimens from the 2 autopsies were evaluated using a 2-step alkaline phosphatase
      immunoassay with a monoclonal antibody to Y. pestis F1 antigen, and tissues that 
      had not been embedded in paraffin were tested for the presence of DNA encoding
      the F1 structural antigen by polymerase chain reaction. Serological evaluation of
      close contacts of the fatalities revealed positive titres to F1 antigen of Y.
      pestis, the aetiological agent of plague, in 3 contacts from the first community 
      and 1 from the second. Immunohistochemical staining of tissues collected from 2
      of the fatalities provided evidence that both had pneumonic plague. Five of 14
      dogs found in the communities were seropositive for plague antibody, providing
      evidence of a recent epizootic plague in the area.

TI  - Epidemiology of Chagas disease in Ecuador. A brief review.
PG  - 387-93
AB  - Chagas disease is a complex public health problem that has been underestimated in
      Ecuador. Here we review the relevant published information, and present
      unpublished and new data that help to understand the current Chagas disease
      epidemiological situation and its evolution in the country. Three main
      characteristics have been identified: (i) persistence of Trypanosoma cruzi
      transmission in already known foci; (ii) a marked endemicity in some urban areas 
      of Guayaquil; and (iii) the transformation of new Amazon foci into truly endemic 
      areas. The situation in other suspect areas remains uncertain. Five Triatominae
      species have been implicated in the transmission of T. cruzi to people in Ecuador
      (Triatoma dimidiata, Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, R. pictipes, R. robustus and
      Panstrongylus geniculatus), but some others may also play a role in some areas
      (P. rufotuberculatus, P. howardi, T. carrioni and P. chinai). Other Triatominae
      reported seem to have little or no epidemiological relevance (T. venosa, T.
      dispar, Eratyrus mucronatus, E. cuspidatus, P. lignarius and Cavernicola pilosa).
      High frequency of acute cases and severe chronic disease has been observed.
      Although cardiomyopathy is more frequent, serious digestive disease is also
      present. It is estimated that around 120,000-200,000 people may be infected. 2.2 
      to 3.8 million people are estimated to live under transmission risk conditions.

      in Ecuador.
PG  - 445-53
AB  - This is a first preliminary study of the validity and reliability of the Matrix
      Analogies Test--Expanded Form in South America. Participants were 104
      Spanish-speaking children between the ages of 5 and 17 years living in Ecuador.
      Values of Cronbach alpha ranged from .87 to .92 for the 4 groups of items and was
      .95 for the total score. Raw scores on the MAT increased across ages. Scores of
      boys did not differ significantly from those of girls. Total test scores
      correlated significantly with scores on the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices
      (r = .62, p < .005; r = .82 before controlling for age). A principal factor
      analysis conducted to provide evidence of the test's construct validity indicated
      that all four sets of items loaded substantially on one unrotated factor,
      presumed to be g. In sum, these results suggest that the test is a valid and
      reliable nonverbal measure of general cognitive ability in this population.

TI  - Pararhinebothroides hobergi n. gen. n. sp. (Eucestoda: Tetraphyllidea) in
      Urobatis tumbesensis (Chondrichthyes: Myliobatiformes) from coastal Ecuador.
PG  - 534-9
AB  - A new species of tetraphyllidean eucestode inhabiting Urobatis tumbesensis from
      inshore waters of southeastern Ecuador shares 3 synapomorphies with
      Rhinebothroides spp.: apical bothridial suckers poorly differentiated from the
      marginal loculi, internal seminal vesicles, and insertion of the vas deferens
      dorsally closer to the poral than the aporal end of the cirrus sac. The new
      species differs from Rhinebothroides spp. by lacking medial bothridial septa and 
      loculi and having symmetrical ovarian arms, and possesses an apparent
      autapomorphic trait by having the vas deferens tapering to a narrow tube before
      entering the cirrus sac, extending posteriorly to the posterior end of the cirrus
      sac where it expands into an external seminal vesicle running ventral to the
      cirrus sac anteriorly to anterior to the vagina. In Rhinebothroides spp., the vas
      deferens is expanded into an external seminal vesicle near the insertion into the
      cirrus sac As the sister group of Rhinebothroides, we propose a new genus to
      accommodate the new species. Phylogenetic evaluation of phyllobothriids recently 
      assigned to Anthocephalum shows that they represent a paraphyletic assemblage of 
      species of varying degrees of relatedness to Rhinebothroides spp. and the new
      species. Uncovering the relationships of the new species and the various species 
      assigned to Anthocephalum permitted reevaluation of character transformations
      used in previous phylogenetic analysis of Rhinebothroides. Transformation series 
      for 3 characters, previously based on functional outgroup comparisons, changed
      and a new character, length of cirrus sac, was added. The new phylogenetic
      analysis differs from the previous hypothesis only in placing R. scorzai as the
      sister species of R. circularisi + R. venezuelae + R. moralarai rather than of R.
      freitasi + R. glandularis + R. mclennanae. The occurrence of the sister species
      of Rhinebothroides in a Pacific Ocean stingray adds additional support to the
      hypothesis of Pacific origins of South American freshwater stingrays.

TI  - Fusarium Wilt Disease Caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli on a Common
      Bean Cultivar, G 2333, in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
PG  - 397
LID - 10.1094/PDIS.1999.83.4.397C [doi]
AB  - The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important source of dietary protein
      for poor resource families in Rwanda and the Kivu region of the Democratic
      Republic of Congo (DRC). During the second season of 1990, symptoms consisting of
      chlorosis, premature defoliation, stunting, wilting, and vascular discoloration
      were observed for the first time on an improved popular climbing bean cultivar, G
      2333, in the prefectures of Butare and Gikongoro, in southwest Rwanda. Between
      1991 and 1994, surveys to determine disease occurrence were conducted in the two 
      prefectures and in Kigali North, Gitarama, Cyangugu, and Kibuye in Rwanda, and in
      the south Kivu region of the DRC. Aseptic isolation from diseased plant samples
      yielded the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli. Pathogenicity tests on G
      2333 seedlings by the root-dip inoculation method resulted in symptoms similar to
      those observed in the field, and recovery of the fungus, fulfilling Koch's
      postulate. Control seedlings gave no symptoms. Disease incidence was 44 and 53%
      in Butare and Gikongoro, respectively, during the first season of 1991 and 50 and
      70% in the second season, while crop loss in some fields was as high as 100%.
      Between 1992 and 1994 the disease was also observed in the four other prefectures
      in Rwanda, and in south Kivu. Climbing bean cultivars Gisenyi-2-bis, G 865, Flora
      de Mayo, and Puebla 444 Criollo, and several bush local varietal mixtures grown
      where the disease occurred, were unaffected. CIAT bean Fusarium wilt
      differentials IPA 1, RIZ 30, A 211, Mortino, Diacol Calima, BAT 477, HF 465-63-1,
      and Ecuador 650, and lines A 300 and XAN 112, were inoculated with three isolates
      (FOP-RW1, FOP-RW2, FOP-RW3) from Rwanda. Only IPA 1, RIZ 30, and A 211 were
      susceptible, indicating the isolates' likeness to the Brazilian race (1). This

TI  - Field screening of blood lead levels in remote Andean villages.
PG  - 871-7
AB  - Blood lead (PbB) levels were investigated in chronically lead (Pb) exposed Andean
      children and adults living in a highly Pb contaminated area of Ecuador where Pb
      glazing of ceramics is prevalent. A comparative study was made of the PbB levels 
      of Pb-glazing and non-Pb-glazing families living in close proximity, using three 
      PbB analysis techniques. Fifty-one, 50-microl blood samples from children and
      adults were analyzed in the field by a finger-stick capillary screening technique
      using the portable ESA LeadCare Blood Lead Testing System (LCS). Venous blood
      samples of 2-4 ml were collected from the same 51 participants and analyzed in
      the laboratory by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and by
      graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The median PbB levels for 
      the Pb-glazing group as determined by the ICP-MS, AAS and LCS techniques were
      37.2 microg/dl (range 11.6-101.0), 32.0 microg/dl (range 8.0-70.0 microg/dl) and 
      44.0 microg/dl (range 19.0-105.0), respectively. The median PbB levels for the
      non-Pb-glazing group were 9.2 microg/dl (range 5.0-21.7) with ICP-MS, 9.0
      microg/dl (range 4.3-32.0) with AAS, and 11.3 microg/dl (range 7.3-21.1) with
      LCS. The differences in PbB levels between the Pb glazing and non-Pb glazing
      groups were statistically significant (p = < .0001) for each PbB analysis method.
      Correlations between paired samples were: LCS and ICP-MS: r = 0.913, LCS and AAS:
      r = 0.829, and ICP-MS and AAS: r = 0.905. The results suggest that neighboring Pb
      glazing and non-Pb glazing families have significantly different PbB levels, and 
      that the portable LCS field technique may be useful for screening and periodic
      monitoring of relatively low and high PbB levels of persons in remote high
      altitude Andean areas.

TI  - Morphological, molecular, and chromosomal discrimination of cryptic Anopheles
      (Nyssorhynchus) (Diptera: Culicidae) from South America.
PG  - 830-8
AB  - Based on similarity of male genitalia, the malaria vector Anopheles trinkae Faran
      from the eastern Andean piedmont of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia was
      determined by Peyton (1993) to be a junior synonym of An. dunhami Causey, then
      known from a single locality in Amazonian Brazil. Following an appraisal of
      molecular, chromosomal, and morphological characters, we conclude herein that the
      2 taxa are specifically distinct and remove An. trinkae from synonymy with An.
      dunhami. Eggs of the 2 species are distinguished easily by the anterior crown,
      long floats, and closed deck that occur only in An. trinkae. The X chromosome of 
      larval polytenes is divisible into R and L arms in An. dunhami, but not in An.
      trinkae. A phenogram based on banding pattern scores from 18 random amplified
      polymorphic DNA primers separated with 100% resolution An. dunhami, An. trinkae, 
      Anopheles nuneztovari Gabaldon and Anopheles darlingi Root. In the ITS2 region of
      rDNA, 25% of base sites distinguished An. trinkae from An. dunhami and 21% from
      the related An. nuneztovari; males of these 3 species had accessory glands of
      significantly different sizes. Preliminary isoenzyme screening indicated that 3
      of 11 loci were diagnostic for separating An. trinkae from An. dunhami. The
      results indicate that An. dunhami is related more closely to An. nuneztovari than
      to An. trinkae and illustrate the merits of a multidisciplinary approach to
      mosquito systematics.

TI  - Stature in Ecuadorians heterozygous for growth hormone receptor gene E180 splice 
      mutation does not differ from that of homozygous normal relatives.
PG  - 2373-5
AB  - Heterozygosity for certain mutations of the GH receptor (GHR) gene has been
      proposed as the cause of partial resistance to GH, and there has been a recent
      demonstration of a dominant-negative effect of such a mutation in a mother and
      child. To examine the effect of heterozygosity in a large genetically homogeneous
      population with GHR deficiency, in which a substantial number of heterozygous
      (carrier) subjects and homozygous normal individuals can be compared, we studied 
      a population in Ecuador in which 70 individuals with GHR deficiency were
      homozygous for the E180 splice mutation. We found that 58 heterozygous relatives 
      of probands were not significantly shorter than 37 homozygous normal relatives
      [SD score (SDS) for height -1.85 +/- 1.04 (SD) vs. -1.55 +/- 0.96, P > 0.10].
      When only those families with both homozygous normals and carriers were compared,
      the 33 heterozygous and 29 normal relatives did not differ significantly in
      height SDS (-1.98 +/- 1.07 vs. -1.77 +/- 0.91, P > 0.3). If heterozygosity for
      the E180 splice mutation were to influence stature, heights of heterozygous
      parents of probands would be expected to correlate with those of probands and of 
      carriers who are their offspring and not with heights of their homozygous normal 
      children. Parental height SDS did not correlate with height SDS of affected
      offspring (r = 0.24). For unaffected siblings as a group or analyzed separately
      as normals or carriers, there was a strong correlation between parental and
      offspring SDS for height (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Thus, the effect of
      homozygosity for the GHR mutation was so profound as to abolish parental
      influence on height, and there was no difference in the influence of parental
      stature between carrier and noncarrier offspring. These findings demonstrate no
      meaningful effect on stature of heterozygosity for the E180 splice mutation of
      the GHR, which is a functional null mutation and, in the homozygous state,
      results in profound short stature from severe insulin-like growth factor-I
      deficiency.

TI  - An outbreak of bartonellosis in Zamora Chinchipe Province in Ecuador.
PG  - 544-6
AB  - We report an outbreak of human bartonellosis in Zamora Chinchipe Province in
      Ecuador, which occurred in 1995-1996. Nineteen cases were seen, of which 18
      presented with classical oroya fever (fever and profound anaemia) and one with
      verruga peruana; 11 of the cases (58%) had positive blood films containing
      Bartonella bacilliformis. The houses of cases and neighbouring controls were
      visited; blood samples for thin films and cultures were collected from members of
      each house and a questionnaire was administered to investigate possible risk
      factors for disease transmission. In none of those sampled was B. bacilliformis
      bacteriologically demonstrable. All case houses were located in isolated areas at
      the margin of forest and the presence of dead rodents was reported only in case
      houses (P < 0.05). We suggest that human bartonellosis is a zoonosis with a
      natural rodent reservoir and that migrant humans infected in this way may become 
      a temporary reservoir host in populated areas.

TI  - First Report of Black Sigatoka in Bolivia.
PG  - 1332
LID - 10.1094/PDIS.1997.81.11.1332C [doi]
AB  - Black Sigatoka, caused by Mycosphaerella fijiensis, is the most important disease
      of banana worldwide (1). It affects cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup that are 
      used for export and important, locally consumed cooking and dessert bananas and
      plantains, reducing yields by 50% or more. Black Sigatoka first appeared in the
      Western Hemisphere in 1972 in Honduras, and has spread to all other countries in 
      Central America (1980), Mexico (1980), and the following islands in the
      Caribbean: Cuba (1992), Hispanola (Dominican Republic) (1996), and Jamaica
      (1994). In South America, the disease has spread to Colombia (1981), Ecuador
      (1986), Venezuela (1992), and Peru (1994) (1). In June 1996, symptoms of the
      disease were observed in the San Carlos area in the western Chapare region of
      Bolivia. During surveys conducted in March and June 1997, several Cavendish
      clones, Dulce Cajita (Pisang mas), Guineo (Silk), Morado (Red), and Platano
      (French and Horn plantain) were affected. In each of eight major banana-producing
      areas in the region, disease incidence and severity were recorded at several
      representative sites on Cavendish cultivars, which were the most widely spread
      and susceptible clones in the region. Disease incidence was 100% in all areas
      from San Carlos to Ingavi B, 30 km to the east, and disease severity, rated as
      the youngest leaf spotted (YLS), ranged from means of 4.5 to 8 in the same areas.
      The disease was less common or rare in the Valle Sajta area, 60 km east of San
      Carlos, the reserve of the Yuqui indigenous group at the confluence of the Rio
      Chimore and Rio Useuta, 15 km northeast of San Carlos, and the southernmost
      settlements of the Yuracare indigenous group on the Rio Chapare, 20 km north of
      Ingavi B (incidences = 0 to 50%). Symptoms began as brown streaks on the abaxial 
      leaf surface, 1 to 3 mm in length, and became visible on the adaxial surface and 
      enlarged to wet, dark brown streaks, 1 to 2 x 10 to 20 mm, with chlorotic haloes.
      Ultimately, large portions of the leaf became blackened and watersoaked. The
      presence of the disease in the San Carlos, Ingavi B, and Senda B areas and the
      Yuqui reserve was confirmed after microscopic examination of the anamorph,
      Paracercospora fijiensis, on affected leaf tissue: scars were present on the base
      of conidia, and only simple conidiophores were found (2). This is the first
      report of black Sigatoka in Bolivia, and represents the southernmost extent of
      the disease on the South American continent. High rainfall in western portions of
      the Chapare (4 to 7 meters per year) makes it unlikely that the disease could be 
      controlled effectively or economically in the region with fungicides. We believe 
      this is the closest approach of the disease to Brazil (ca. 700 km), the last
      major banana-producing country in which black Sigatoka has not been reported.
      Moreover, the outbreaks in the northern Chapare are thought to be the first
      across the colonist frontier to indigenous Amazonian populations that rely on
      plantains and bananas as staple foods. References: (1) X. Mourichon and R. A.

TI  - Apolipoprotein B and E genetic polymorphisms in the Cayapa Indians of Ecuador.
PG  - 375-82
AB  - Three DNA polymorphisms (XbaI, EcoRI, and Ins/Del) of the apolipoprotein B (APOB)
      gene and the CfoI polymorphism of the APOE gene were investigated in a sample of 
      96 Cayapa Indians from Ecuador. The frequencies of the X+ (0.182), R+ (1.000),
      and Del alleles (0.432) at the three APOB sites were found to be higher than and 
      to differ significantly from those reported for East Asians. No comparisons could
      be made between the Cayapa and other native Americans because of the lack of data
      on these sites. We observed in our sample that, like native American populations 
      but unlike East Asians, the APOE allele frequencies were characterized by the
      absence of the APOE*2 allele and by a high frequency of the APOE*4 allele
      (0.280). Besides a probable drift effect, the high APOE*4 value was tentatively
      attributed to an effect of selection. Because this allele enhances the absorption
      of cholesterol by the intestine, it could confer an advantage to carriers in an
      unfavorable environment (i.e., diet poor in cholesterol).

TI  - Onchocerciasis and reproductive health in Ecuador.
PG  - 315-7
AB  - A retrospective study was performed comparing the number of spontaneous abortions
      in a hyperendemic area for onchocerciasis in Ecuador before and after invermectin
      treatment with that of a comparable non-endemic area. The frequency of
      spontaneous abortions was associated with a change in the community microfilarial
      load, suggesting that there may be a relationship between spontaneous abortions
      and infection with Onchocerca volvulus. In the endemic area, a significantly
      greater rate of spontaneous abortions was seen in the period before ivermectin
      distribution compared to that after the start of ivermectin treatments every 6
      months. In the non-endemic area, no change in the rate of spontaneous abortions
      was seen over the same time period. In addition to the well-documented
      improvements in skin and ocular disease, ivermectin may also improve the
      reproductive health of endemic populations.

TI  - Bartonellosis in Zamora Chinchipe province in Ecuador.
PG  - 241-3
AB  - Human bartonellosis was investigated in the Ecuadorian province of Zamora
      Chinchipe; 17 cases were identified retrospectively from hospital records over
      the period 1984-1995, mostly from 6 communities in the provincial district of
      Zumba. A questionnaire concerning risk factors for disease transmission was
      administered in these 6 communities. Blood samples were taken from individuals
      with current febrile illnesses or skin lesions suggestive of bartonellosis.
      Samples for detection of Bartonella bacilliformis were also taken from all
      school-age children in communities where historical cases had been identified by 
      questionnaire. No bacteriologically positive case was identified and no evidence 
      of asymptomatic infection was detected. Risk factors for disease transmission,
      identified by the questionnaire, included the presence of sick or dying chickens 
      and guinea-pigs. It was suggested that bartonellosis is a zoonosis with wild
      animals, probably rodents, as the reservoir. The widespread use of residual
      insecticides and the easy availability of antibiotics is likely to have modified 
      the epidemiology of this disease over the last decade.

TI  - Treatment of snake bites by Bothrops species and Lachesis muta in Ecuador:
      laboratory screening of candidate antivenoms.
PG  - 550-4
AB  - Bothrops xanthogrammus/asper, B. atrox and Lachesis muta are probably responsible
      for most cases of severe envenoming in Ecuador. In recent years, the most widely 
      used antivenom ('Myn' Ronti, imported from Mexico) has proved clinically
      ineffective. There is an urgent need to identify an effective alternative for
      clinical testing. Five antivenoms with activity against Bothrops venoms were
      compared using standard World Health Organization rodent and in vitro assays: (i)
      'Myn', Ronti Mexico SA ('B. atrox', 'Crotalus terrificus'), (ii) Instituto
      Butantan (Bothrops polyvalent, Brazil), (iii) Instituto Nacional de Hygiene y
      Medicina Tropical (Bothrops polyvalent, Ecuador), (iv) Instituto Nacional de
      Salud (B. asper, C. durissus and Lachesis muta, Colombia), and (v) Laboratorios
      Probiol (Bothrops, Lachesis and Crotalus, Colombia). The venoms against which
      these antivenoms were tested were Ecuadorian B. atrox, B. asper and B.
      xanthogrammus. Brazilian antivenom proved to be the most effective, followed by
      the Ecudorian and Colombian antivenoms. Mexican antivenom was completely
      ineffective in neutralizing the lethal effects of Ecuadorian Bothrops venoms.
      Monospecific Brazilian L. muta antivenom (Instituto Butantan) proved effective
      against Ecuadorian L. muta venom, but the Colombian polyspecific antivenoms did
      not. Clinical trials of Brazilian and Ecuadorian antivenoms are planned in the
      Amazon region of Ecuador in the near future.

TI  - Comparison of the heart rate-monitoring and factorial methods: assessment of
      energy expenditure in highland and coastal Ecuadoreans.
PG  - 1146-52
AB  - Accurate estimates of total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) are critical to
      studies of the nutritional adaptation of human populations. This study compared
      the standard factorial method with the recently developed flex-HR technique in a 
      sample of 32 adults (16 males, 16 females) from rural, agricultural communities
      of highland and coastal Ecuador. Although energy expenditures obtained from the
      two methods were highly correlated (r = 0.759, P < 0.0001), the 1985 FAO/WHO/UNU 
      factorial method significantly underestimated TDEE relative to the heart
      rate-monitoring technique (10.27 +/- 2.54 compared with 11.91 +/- 3.96 MJ/d, P < 
      0.001). The degree of underestimation was greater in males, who had higher energy
      expenditures. Similarly, underestimation was greater in the highland farmers, who
      were studied during a period of heavy agricultural work. The differences in
      energy expenditure estimates translated into a 10% difference in estimated energy
      adequacy. Additional research is needed to identify the potential sources of bias
      in the factorial method and to further develop other techniques for accurately
      estimating energy expenditure under field conditions.

TI  - Topical treatment of American cutaneous leishmaniasis with paramomycin and

PG  - 92-4
AB  - Fifty-two patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) from the Pacific
      coast of Ecuador were treated topically with an ointment containing 15%
      paramomycin (PR) and 12% methylbenzethonium chloride (MBCL) in vaselinum album
      (white soft paraffin; white petrolatum). After 20 applications (over 10 or 20 d) 
      all lesions showed complete epithelialization within the first 100 d. Five
      patients developed new lesions during the one year observation period; 2 of these
      were probably reinfections. Considering all 5 cases as treatment failures, the
      healing rates were: 72% after 50 d, 90% after 100 d, and 85% after 360 d. In a
      separate study in the same area, a group of 23 patients was left without
      treatment for 3 months. Only 9% of the untreated patients healed spontaneously
      after 50 d. Growth of the lesion, inflammation and pain were observed at the
      beginning of treatment. After treatment, most lesions healed rapidly without
      scars. The drug was well accepted by the patients and was easy to administer
      under tropical field conditions.

TI  - Tropical pyomyositis in eastern Ecuador.
PG  - 90-1
AB  - In the ten year period 1980-1989, 97 patients were treated for tropical
      pyomyositis at Hospital Vozandes Oriente in eastern Ecuador, accounting for 2.2% 
      of surgical admissions. Operation records from an affiliated hospital in Quito
      showed that, high on the Andean plateau, pyomyositis accounted for only 0.1% of
      surgical admissions. Among the patient population of Ecuador's eastern tropical
      rain forest, persons who were members of an indigenous ethnic group were affected
      with pyomyositis twice as often as would be expected from their representation in
      the general population.

TI  - The effect of antimalarial chloroquine therapy and prophylaxis on concurrent
      infection with Onchocerca volvulus in Ecuador.
PG  - 634-8
AB  - The effect of chloroquine phosphate on Onchocerca volvulus in vivo was studied in
      Ecuadorians undergoing treatment for malaria. All persons with a diagnosis of
      acute malaria and treated with 2500 mg of chloroquine over 3 d showed a 100%
      reduction of dermal O. volvulus microfilariae 7 d after treatment. However, 28 d 
      after treatment the microfilarial densities returned to their pre-treatment
      levels and at 35 d they had increased to 121.6% of their pre-treatment values.
      Treatment did not appear to have any effect on the adult O. volvulus examined
      histologically in extirpated nodules. Patients treated for acute malaria and
      subsequently kept on a prophylactic regimen of 500 mg chloroquine weekly showed a
      reduction of 56.7% from pre-treatment microfilarial density after 27 weeks.
      Patients who underwent nodulectomy as well as treatment for acute malaria and
      were given 500 mg of chloroquine prophylactically for 27 weeks showed a reduction
      in dermal microfilarial density of 93.6%. Symptoms of onchocerciasis were reduced
      in the latter group of patients, with the elimination of all acute dermatological
      changes within 6 weeks. Ocular examination of these surgically and
      chemotherapeutically treated individuals revealed reductions of 94.9% of
      microfilariae in the anterior chamber, 95.9% of live microfilariae in the cornea,
      and 95.1% of dead microfilariae in the cornea. There was a reduction of 69.8% in 
      corneal fluffy opacities. No alteration in the visual acuity or in visible
      lesions in the posterior segment was recorded. The results suggest that a complex
      interaction between chloroquine and O. volvulus takes place in vivo, which can be
      beneficial to the patient over a long period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 337-47
AB  - Teratorhabditis palmarum n. sp., an associate of the palm weevils Rhynchophorus
      palmarum and R. cruentatus is described. Teratorhabditis palmarum was isolated
      from newly emerged adults and cocoons of R. palmarum from red-ring diseased
      coconut palms, Cocos nucifera, in Trinidad and Ecuador, and from red-ring
      diseased oil palms, Elaeis guineensis, in Colombia. Teratorhabditis palmarum was 
      also associated internally with newly emerged adults of R. cruentatus from mature
      transplanted cabbage palmettos, Sabal palmetto, in Florida. Dauer juveniles of T.
      palmarum infested the genital capsule and body cavity of newly emerged adult
      female and male palm weevils. Adult nematodes isolated from cocoons and dauer
      juveniles from newly emerged palm weevils were cuhurable on bacterial lawns on
      several solid media. Females of T. palmarum have a single anteriorly directed
      ovary; vulva at 93-96% of the body length; short, hemispherical spicate tail;
      three or four teeth in the metastom; cuticle with distinct transverse punctations
      that change abruptly at the level of the procorpus to indentations of alternating
      size and arrangement; and eggs with cuticular sculpturing. Males have a crenate, 
      peloderan bursa with a 2 + 5 + 3 pattern of bursal rays (7 extend to the margin
      of bursa); spicules linear, completely fused at the distal tip and dorsally for
      50% of the total spicule length.

TI  - Onchocerciasis in Ecuador: infection in children in the Santiago Basin focus,
      province of Esmeraldas.
PG  - 109-12
AB  - The prevalence of onchocerciasis infection in children aged 1-12 in the Santiago 
      Basin focus, province of Esmeraldas, Ecuador, was determined to see if active
      transmission of the disease had occurred in the past 6 years. An infection rate
      of 45.0% was found. Compared to that found in 1980 (14.5%), the infection rate
      had increased by 210.1%. The increase was greater on the Rio Santiago (340.5%)
      than on the Rio Cayapas (195.5%). An increase of 286% was seen in the skin
      microfilarial density in the 1-4 year age group, with a 56.8% increase in the
      5-12 year age group. The prevalence of infection in children aged 0-4 years
      (those born since the first enquiry in 1980) was 64.3%, with an average skin
      microfilarial density of 12.2 microfilariae (mf)/mg and with 20% presenting
      nodules, of which 92.1% occurred in the head region. Of the 34 children examined 
      aged less than one year, 25 (73.5%) were positive for microfilariae with an
      average microfilarial skin density of 9.6 mf/mg. These data suggest that there is
      active transmission of the disease in the Santiago Basin onchocercal foci.

TI  - Snake venoms in science and clinical medicine. 2. Applied immunology in snake
      venom research.
PG  - 741-4
AB  - Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a very important tool for studying
      both the epidemiology and clinical effects of snake bite in man. For epidemiology
      ELISA depends on the development and persistence of specific humoral venom
      antibody in previous snake bite victims. In the Nigerian savanna 63% of previous 
      bite victims possessed specific venom antibodies against Echis carinatus venom;
      in Ecuador, where there is a 5% annual mortality due to snake bite in a
      population of Waorani Indians, venom antibodies against a wide range of different
      venoms were identified in previous bite victims using ELISA. In certain areas it 
      is often not possible, using the symptoms of envenoming, to determine which
      species of snake has bitten the patient. Field studies using ELISA in Nigeria and
      Thailand have been successful in establishing the species responsible for
      envenoming. Current studies are in progress on the development of a rapid
      immunoassay which should be capable of detecting the biting species within 5-10
      min of sampling from the admission patient. This will be useful for the clinician
      as it will enable the rapid detection of the species responsible for envenoming
      and, therefore, the use of the correct antivenom. Experimental work on the
      development of new methods of antivenom production includes immunization of
      experimental animals with venom/liposome preparations, the preparation of venom
      antigens using monoclonal antibodies on affinity columns, and recombinant
      deoxyribonucleic acid technology. Liposomal immunization requires only a single
      injection of venom to obtain a rapid, high level and protective immune response. 
      Venom liposomes may also be given orally resulting in a serum immunoglobulin G
      immune response in experimental animals. Use of such a system may eventually
      result in immunization of man in areas of high snake bite incidence and
      mortality.

TI  - The relationship between severity of ulcerated lesions and immune responses in
      the early stage of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ecuador.
PG  - 681-5
AB  - The relationship was examined between the severity of ulcerated lesions and
      immune responses in 19 Ecuadorian patients in the early stages of New World
      cutaneous leishmaniasis. As an immunological assay, the humoral immune response
      was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the cell-mediated
      response by delayed type skin test for leishmanial antigen (leishmanin test).
      There was a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.61, P less than 0.01)
      between the total area of ulcerated lesions and the reciprocal titre of ELISA in 
      identical subjects. However, no significant difference was observed in the ELISA 
      titre between patients with a single lesion and those with multiple lesions (chi 
      2 = 7.06, df = 5, P greater than 0.2). A correlation (r = 0.48, P less than 0.05)
      was observed between the area of lesions and the intensity of leishmanin test;
      further, the ELISA titre also correlated to the intensity of leishmanin test in
      the identical subjects (r = 0.71, P less than 0.01). These results suggest that
      the severity of ulcerated lesions relates to the activation of both the humoral
      and cell-mediated immune systems in the early stage of New World cutaneous
      leishmaniasis.

TI  - Association of electrocardiographic abnormalities with seropositivity to
      Trypanosoma cruzi in Ecuador.
PG  - 7-10
AB  - In highland Ecuador (province of El Oro), electrocardiograms (ECGs) were taken
      and analysed from 340 subjects, of whom 154 were seropositive to Trypanosoma
      cruzi by indirect haemagglutination test. Abnormal ECGs were present in 40.3% of 
      seropositive individuals and 8.1% of seronegatives, and were slightly more common
      in seropositive males than in seropositive females. In seropositive individuals, 
      the prevalence of abnormal ECG progressively increased with age and reached its
      peak level of 64.0% in the age group over 60 years, implying that Chagas disease 
      in Ecuador produces little mortality among seropositive individuals. The most
      common ECG alterations were ventricular conduction defects: 26 of 117
      seropositive individuals in the age group over 40 years had complete right bundle
      branch block. The frequency of atrioventricular block and arrhythmias was also
      associated with seropositivity to T. cruzi. A further ECG examination in lowland 
      (province of Guayas) showed that the prevalence of abnormal ECGs there was
      significantly lower than that in highlands. These results suggest possible
      differences between T. cruzi strains in the two geographical areas of Ecuador.

AB  - A survey showed the presence of seven simuliid species in the onchocerciasis
      focus in Ecuador Simulium exiguum and S. quadrivittatum were the two most common 
      anthropophilic species and were shown to be both experimental and natural vectors
      of Onchocerca volvulus. S. antillarum only occasionally bit man. Observations
      were made on the biology of the two vector species and it was evident that S.
      exiguum was the primary vector of onchocerciasis in the rainy season. The
      relevance of these findings to the epidemiology and control of onchocerciasis in 
      Ecuador are discussed.

TI  - Onchocerciasis in Ecuador, IV. Comparative studies of the disease relating to the
      Chachi and black populations in the province of Esmeraldas.
PG  - 86-90
AB  - The frequency, intensity and clinical features of onchocerciasis in the two
      ethnic groups (Blacks and Chachilla--an indigenous tribe) in the endemic foci of 
      the disease in Esmeraldas province (Ecuador) were evaluated. The incidence of
      infection and intensity of the disease seen in both groups were directly related 
      to the frequency of man-vector contact and not to racial factors. Both groups
      showed the same rate of positivity in both the hyperendemic and hypoendemic
      areas. Males of both groups had a consistently higher positivity rate than did
      females. The Chachilla were found to have a higher mean microfilarial density
      than Blacks in both types of endemic areas. Certain clinical features of the
      disease analogous to those seen in the African form were present only in Blacks. 
      No lymphatic involvement or hypertrophic scarring was seen in the Chachilla,
      suggesting that in the Blacks there may be a generaically related predisposition 
      to lymphatic complications of microfilarial infections.

TI  - Onchocerciasis in Ecuador. III. Clinical manifestations of the disease in the
      province of Esmeraldas.
PG  - 81-5
AB  - Considerable variation in the frequency of the clinical manifestations of
      onchocerciasis was seen in the individual endemic foci of the disease in province
      of Esmeraldas, Ecuador. In hypoendemic areas, 84.6% of all microfilaria-positive 
      inhabitants were found to be free of any clinical manifestations of the disease, 
      whereas in the hyperendemic area clinical manifestations were present in 57.9% of
      those infected. Ocular keratitis, macular papular rash of the skin and
      subcutaneous onchocercal nodules of varying frequency were the major clinical
      variants. Long-standing onchodermatitis and hypertrophy of the skin were rarely
      seen. Clinical evidence of prolonged ocular and skin invasion by microfilariae
      was seen only in the hyperendemic area. Of the 26.1% of the microfilaria-positive
      inhabitants who had onchocercal nodules, 91.7% lived in the hyperendemic area.
      41.1% of all nodules occurred in the region of the iliac crest. Clinical
      conditions associated with high microfilarial density, i.e., elephantiasis of the
      legs and scrotum, lymphadenopathy, hanging groin, hydrocele and inguinal hernia
      were seen only in the hyperendemic area. The clinical features were similar to
      those seen in Africa, but the low incidence of the clinical presentation and
      severity of the disease suggested a recent infestation of the province.

      determine IgG and IgE serum antibody levels in 43 patients from Ecuador before
      and after therapy with praziquantel. ELISA indicated infection more sensitively
      than IHA. The tendency of increasing antibody levels between the first and second
      month after therapy was more distinct when measured by IHA, whereas the decreases
      of antibody levels between the third and sixth month after treatment was more
      distinct when measured by ELISA. The IgG ELISA for detecting long persisting
      antibody was more sensitive than IHA.
