TI  - An insight into reactivity and bioactivity properties of quorum sensing peptides 
      against PDE10A: a computational peptidology approach.

AB  - Peptides are currently the most promising lead molecules. Quorum sensing peptides
      have a variety of structural features and are regularly exposed to
      post-translational modifications. Antiparkinsonian drugs lose their efficacy
      after a long period of use, and patients develop motor problems such as
      drug-induced dyskinesia (DIDs). The interaction between PDE10A and cAMP is
      necessary for dopamine neurotransmission and may play a role in Parkinson's
      disease pathogenesis. cAMP and cGMP are cyclic nucleotides that act as secondary 
      messengers in the signal transduction pathway, influencing a range of CNS
      activities. PDE enzymes hydrolyze phosphodiester bonds to break down cAMP and
      cGMP, allowing them to control intracellular levels of these second messengers
      effectively. PDE expression, and hence cyclic nucleotide levels and their
      downstream targets, may change with age and in numerous age-related illnesses,
      including Parkinson's disease, according to mounting evidence. At the peak of
      dyskinesias, cyclic nucleotide levels were lower, and using phosphodiesterase
      inhibitors before antiparkinsonian medicines reduced the severity of dyskinesias.
      In a recent study, PapRIV was found to have the ability to activate BV-2
      microglia cells, indicating that this quorum sensing peptide may play a role in
      gut-brain contact. As a result of the current in silico work, mainly focused on
      QSPs as a lead molecule for inhibiting PDE10A, the SRNAT QSP sequence has been a 
      potent molecule in molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations.
      Furthermore, we can test the efficiency of therapeutic components in vitro and in
      vivo utilizing this computational approach against PDE10A.

AB  - Activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 (ACK1/TNK2) has a significant role in cell
      endocytosis, survival, proliferation, and migration. Mutations in ACK1 are
      closely associated with the occurrence and development of cancers. In this work, 
      a conceptual density functional theory (CDFT)-based computational peptidology
      (CDFT-CP) method is used to study the chemical reactivity of 14 multikinase
      inhibitors. Optical properties of these inhibitors are studied by time-dependent 
      density functional theory (TDDFT). Various biological and pharmacokinetic
      parameters are studied by Osiris, Molinspiration, and BOILED-Egg in SwissADME
      software tools. Physicochemical and biopharmaceutical (PCB), Salmonella
      typhimurium reverse mutation assay (AMES) mutagenicity, toxicity, and risk
      prediction are estimated by Simulations plus ADMET Predictor 10.2 software. MD
      simulations for an active model of ACK1 is carried out by the CABS-flex 2.0 web
      server, and potential binding pockets for ACK1 are searched using the PrankWeb
      server. SwissTargetPrediction is used to predict the potential targets for the
      multikinase inhibitors. Docking studies are carried out for ACK1-multikinase
      inhibitors using Autodock 4.2 software. Noncovalent interactions for
      ACK1-multikinase inhibitor complexes are studied using the Protein-Ligand
      Interaction Profiler (PLIP) server. Results indicated higher binding affinities
      and strong noncovalent interactions in ACK1-multikinase inhibitor complexes.

TI  - Integrated unsupervised-supervised modeling and prediction of protein-peptide
      affinities at structural level.
LID - bbac097 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbac097 [doi]
AB  - Cell signal networks are orchestrated directly or indirectly by various
      peptide-mediated protein-protein interactions, which are normally weak and
      transient and thus ideal for biological regulation and medicinal intervention.
      Here, we develop a general-purpose method for modeling and predicting the binding
      affinities of protein-peptide interactions (PpIs) at the structural level. The
      method is a hybrid strategy that employs an unsupervised approach to derive a
      layered PpI atom-residue interaction (ulPpI[a-r]) potential between different
      protein atom types and peptide residue types from thousands of solved PpI complex
      structures and then statistically correlates the potential descriptors with
      experimental affinities (KD values) over hundreds of known PpI samples in a
      supervised manner to create an integrated unsupervised-supervised PpI affinity
      (usPpIA) predictor. Although both the ulPpI[a-r] potential and usPpIA predictor
      can be used to calculate PpI affinities from their complex structures, the latter
      seems to perform much better than the former, suggesting that the unsupervised
      potential can be improved substantially with a further correction by supervised
      statistical learning. We examine the robustness and fault-tolerance of usPpIA
      predictor when applied to treat the coarse-grained PpI complex structures modeled
      computationally by sophisticated peptide docking and dynamics simulation. It is
      revealed that, despite developed solely based on solved structures, the
      integrated unsupervised-supervised method is also applicable for locally docked
      structures to reach a quantitative prediction but can only give a qualitative
      prediction on globally docked structures. The dynamics refinement seems not to
      change (or improve) the predictive results essentially, although it is
      computationally expensive and time-consuming relative to peptide docking. We also
      perform extrapolation of usPpIA predictor to the indirect affinity quantities of 
      HLA-A*0201 binding epitope peptides and NHERF PDZ binding scaffold peptides,
      consequently resulting in a good and moderate correlation of the predicted KD
      with experimental IC50 and BLU on the two peptide sets, with Pearson's
      correlation coefficients Rp = 0.635 and 0.406, respectively.

TI  - Conceptual DFT-Based Computational Peptidology, Pharmacokinetics Study and ADMET 
      Report of the Veraguamides A-G Family of Marine Natural Drugs.
LID - 97 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20020097 [doi]
AB  - As a continuation of our research on the chemical reactivity, pharmacokinetics
      and ADMET properties of cyclopeptides of marine origin with potential therapeutic
      abilities, in this work our already presented integrated molecular modeling
      protocol has been used for the study of the chemical reactivity and bioactivity
      properties of the Veraguamides A-G family of marine natural drugs. This protocol 
      results from the estimation of the conceptual density functional theory (CDFT)
      chemical reactivity descriptors together with several chemoinformatics tools
      commonly considered within the process of development of new therapeutic drugs.
      CP-CDFT is a branch of computational chemistry and molecular modeling dedicated
      to the study of peptides, and it is a protocol that allows the estimation with
      great accuracy of the CDFT-based reactivity descriptors and the associated
      physical and chemical properties, which can aid in determining the ability of the
      studied peptides to behave as potential useful drugs. Moreover, the superiority
      of the MN12SX density functional over other long-range corrected density
      functionals for the prediction of chemical and physical properties in the
      presence of water as the solvent is clearly demonstrated. The research was
      supplemented with an investigation of the bioactivity of the molecular systems
      and their ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity)
      parameters, as is customary in medicinal chemistry. Some instances of the
      CDFT-based chemical reactivity descriptors' capacity to predict the pKas of
      peptides as well as their potential as AGE inhibitors are also shown.

TI  - Systematic Modeling, Prediction, and Comparison of Domain-Peptide Affinities:
      Does it Work Effectively With the Peptide QSAR Methodology?
PG  - 800857
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2021.800857 [doi]
AB  - The protein-protein association in cellular signaling networks (CSNs) often acts 
      as weak, transient, and reversible domain-peptide interaction (DPI), in which a
      flexible peptide segment on the surface of one protein is recognized and bound by
      a rigid peptide-recognition domain from another. Reliable modeling and accurate
      prediction of DPI binding affinities would help to ascertain the diverse
      biological events involved in CSNs and benefit our understanding of various
      biological implications underlying DPIs. Traditionally, peptide quantitative
      structure-activity relationship (pQSAR) has been widely used to model and predict
      the biological activity of oligopeptides, which employs amino acid descriptors
      (AADs) to characterize peptide structures at sequence level and then
      statistically correlate the resulting descriptor vector with observed activity
      data via regression. However, the QSAR has not yet been widely applied to treat
      the direct binding behavior of large-scale peptide ligands to their protein
      receptors. In this work, we attempted to clarify whether the pQSAR methodology
      can work effectively for modeling and predicting DPI affinities in a
      high-throughput manner? Over twenty thousand short linear motif (SLiM)-containing
      peptide segments involved in SH3, PDZ and 14-3-3 domain-medicated CSNs were
      compiled to define a comprehensive sequence-based data set of DPI affinities,
      which were represented by the Boehringer light units (BLUs) derived from previous
      arbitrary light intensity assays following SPOT peptide synthesis. Four
      sophisticated MLMs (MLMs) were then utilized to perform pQSAR modeling on the set
      described with different AADs to systematically create a variety of linear and
      nonlinear predictors, and then verified by rigorous statistical test. It is
      revealed that the genome-wide DPI events can only be modeled qualitatively or
      semiquantitatively with traditional pQSAR strategy due to the intrinsic disorder 
      of peptide conformation and the potential interplay between different peptide
      residues. In addition, the arbitrary BLUs used to characterize DPI affinity
      values were measured via an indirect approach, which may not very reliable and
      may involve strong noise, thus leading to a considerable bias in the modeling.
      The R prd (2) = 0.7 can be considered as the upper limit of external
      generalization ability of the pQSAR methodology working on large-scale DPI
      affinity data.

TI  - Computational peptidology approach to the study of the chemical reactivity and
      bioactivity properties of Aspergillipeptide D, a cyclopentapeptide of marine
      origin.
PG  - 506
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-04513-z [doi]
AB  - Aspergillipeptide D is a cyclic pentapeptide isolated from the marine gorgonian
      Melitodes squamata-derived fungus Aspergillus sp. SCSIO 41501 that it has been
      shown to present moderate activity against herpes virus simplex type 1 (HSV-1).
      Thus, this paper presents the results of a computational study of this
      cyclopentapeptide's chemical reactivity and bioactivity properties using a
      CDFT-based computational peptidology (CDFT-CP) methodology, which is derived from
      combining chemical reactivity descriptors derived from Conceptual Density
      Functional Theory (CDFT) and some Cheminformatics tools which may be used. This
      results in an improvement of the virtual screening procedure by a similarity
      search allowing the identification and validation of the known ability of the
      peptide to act as a possible useful drug. This was followed by an examination of 
      the drug's bioactivity and pharmacokinetics indices in relation to the ADMET
      (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) characteristics. 
      The findings provide further evidence of the MN12SX density functional's
      superiority in proving the Janak and Ionization Energy theorems using the
      proposed KID approach. This has proven to be beneficial in accurately predicting 
      CDFT reactivity characteristics, which aid in the understanding of chemical
      reactivity. The Computational Pharmacokinetics study revealed the potential
      ability of Aspergillipeptide D as a therapeutic drug through the interaction with
      different target receptors. The ADMET indices confirm this assertion through the 
      absence of toxicity and good absorption and distribution properties.

AB  - Homophymines A-E and A1-E1 are bioactive natural cyclodepsipeptides with a
      complex molecular architecture. These molecules could have a potential use as
      antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer substances. We have carried out a
      computational study of the properties of this family of marine peptides using a
      CDFT-based Computational Peptidology (CDFT-CP) methodology that results from the 
      combination of the chemical reactivity descriptors that arise from conceptual
      Density Functional Theory (CDFT) together with cheminformatics tools. The latter 
      can be used to estimate the associated physicochemical parameters and to improve 
      the process of virtual screening through a similarity search. Using this
      approach, the ability of the peptides to behave as a potentially useful drugs can
      be investigated. An analysis of their bioactivity and pharmacokinetics indices
      related to the ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and
      Toxicity) features has also been carried out.

AB  - An integrated molecular modeling protocol resulting from the combination of
      conceptual density functional theory (CDFT) chemical reactivity descriptors with 
      several chemoinformatics tools has been used for the study of the chemical
      reactivity and bioactivity properties of a group of marine cyclic peptides.
      CP-CDFT is a branch of computational chemistry and molecular modeling dedicated
      to the study of peptides. The protocol allowed the estimation of the CDFT-based
      reactivity indices together with the associated physicochemical parameters that
      can help to identify the ability of the studied peptides to behave as potential
      useful drugs. This was complemented with an analysis of the bioactivity and
      pharmacokinetics parameters related to the ADMET (absorption, distribution,
      metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) features. Some examples related to the
      ability of the CDFT-based chemical reactivity descriptors for the prediction of
      the pKas of the peptides as well as their potential as AGE inhibitors are also
      presented.

      Cyclopeptides Isolated From Rosaceae as a Computational Peptidology Approach.

AB  - This research presents the outcomes of a computational determination of the
      chemical reactivity and bioactivity properties of two plant cyclopeptides
      isolated from Rosaceae through the consideration of Computational Peptidology
      (CP), a protocol employed previously in the research of similar molecular
      systems. CP allows the prediction of the global and local descriptors that are
      the integral foundations of Conceptual Density Functional Theory (CDFT) and which
      could help in getting in the understanding of the chemical reactivity properties 
      of the two plant cyclopeptides under study, hoping that they could be related to 
      their bioactivity. The methodology based on the Koopmans in DFT (KID) approach
      and the MN12SX/Def2TZVP/H2O model chemistry has been successfully validated.
      Various Chemoinformatics tools have been used to improve the process of virtual
      screening, thus identifying some additional properties of these two plant
      cyclopeptides connected to their ability to behave as potentially useful drugs.
      With the further objective of analyzing their bioactivity, the CP protocol is
      complemented with the estimation of some useful parameters related to
      pharmacokinetics, their predicted biological targets, and the Absorption,
      Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) parameters related to
      the bioavailability of the two plant cyclopeptides under study are also reported.

TI  - Systematic Comparison and Comprehensive Evaluation of 80 Amino Acid Descriptors
      in Peptide QSAR Modeling.
PG  - 1718-1731
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01370 [doi]
AB  - The peptide quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), also known as
      the quantitative sequence-activity model (QSAM), has attracted much attention in 
      the bio- and chemoinformatics communities and is a well developed computational
      peptidology strategy to statistically correlate the sequence/structure and
      activity/property relationships of functional peptides. Amino acid descriptors
      (AADs) are one of the most widely used methods to characterize peptide structures
      by decomposing the peptide into its residue building blocks and sequentially
      parametrizing each building block with a vector of amino acid principal
      properties. Considering that various AADs have been proposed over the past
      decades and new AADs are still emerging today, we herein query the following: is 
      it necessary to develop so many AADs and do we need to continuously develop more 
      new AADs? In this study, we exhaustively collect 80 published AADs and
      comprehensively evaluate their modeling performance (including fitting ability,
      internal stability, and predictive power) on 8 QSAR-oriented peptide sample sets 
      (QPSs) by employing 2 sophisticated machine learning methods (MLMs), totally
      building and systematically comparing 1280 (80 AADs x 8 QPSs x 2 MLMs) peptide
      QSAR models. The following is revealed: (i) None of the AADs can work best on all
      or most peptide sets; an AAD usually performs well for some peptides but badly
      for others. (ii) Modeling performance is primarily determined by the peptide
      samples and then the MLMs used, while AADs have only a moderate influence on the 
      performance. (iii) There is no essential difference between the modeling
      performances of different AAD types (physiochemical, topological, 3D-structural, 
      etc.). (iv) Two random descriptors, which are separately generated randomly in
      standard normal distribution N(0, 1) and uniform distribution U(-1, +1), do not
      perform significantly worse than these carefully developed AADs. (v) A secondary 
      descriptor, which carries major information involved in the 80 (primary) AADs,
      does not perform significantly better than these AADs. Overall, we conclude that 
      since there are various AADs available to date and they already cover numerous
      amino acid properties, further development of new AADs is not an essential choice
      to improve peptide QSAR modeling; the traditional AAD methodology is believed to 
      have almost reached the theoretical limit nowadays. In addition, the AADs are
      more likely to be a vector symbol but not informative data; they are utilized to 
      mark and distinguish the 20 amino acids but do not really bring much original
      property information to these amino acids.

AB  - This work presents the results of a computational study of the chemical
      reactivity and bioactivity properties of the members of the theopapuamides A-D
      family of marine peptides by making use of our proposed methodology named
      Computational Peptidology (CP) that has been successfully considered in previous 
      studies of this kind of molecular system. CP allows for the determination of the 
      global and local descriptors that come from Conceptual Density Functional Theory 
      (CDFT) that can give an idea about the chemical reactivity properties of the
      marine natural products under study, which are expected to be related to their
      bioactivity. At the same time, the validity of the procedure based on the
      adoption of the KID (Koopmans In DFT) technique, as well as the
      MN12SX/Def2TZVP/H2O model chemistry is successfully verified. Together with
      several chemoinformatic tools that can be used to improve the process of virtual 
      screening, some additional properties of these marine peptides are identified
      related to their ability to behave as useful drugs. With the further objective of
      analyzing their bioactivity, some useful parameters for future QSAR studies,
      their predicted biological targets, and the ADMET (Absorption, Distribution,
      Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) parameters related to the theopapuamides A-D 
      pharmacokinetics are also reported.

      named Conceptual Density Functional Theory (CDFT) was chosen for the calculation

      acquired by depending on a homology model by studying the correlation with the
      known bioactivity of related molecules in their interaction with various

AB  - A methodology based on the concepts that arise from Density Functional Theory
      (CDFT) was chosen for the calculation of the global and local reactivity
      descriptors of the Phallotoxin family of fungal peptides. The determination of
      the active sites for the molecules has been achieved by resorting some
      descriptors within Molecular Electron Density Theory (MEDT) like the Dual
      Descriptor and the Parr functions. Phallosacin has been found as the most
      reactive of the peptides on the basis of the calculated Global Reactivity
      Descriptors. The pKas of the seven studied peptides were established using a
      proposed relationship between this property and the calculated Global Hardness.
      The bioactivity properties of the peptides considered in this study were obtained
      by resorting to a homology model by comparison with the bioactivity of related
      molecules in their interaction with different receptors.

AB  - A well-behaved model chemistry previously validated for the study of the chemical
      reactivity of peptides was considered for the calculation of the molecular
      properties and structures of a group of five new antifungal tripeptides, namely
      (2R)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]propanamido]-5-[(diaminomethylid
      ene)amino]pentanoic acid, (2S)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenyl
      propanamido]propanamido]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid,
      (2S)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]-3-methylbutanamido]-3-(4-hydrox
      yphenyl)propanoic acid,
      (2R)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamido]-3
      -sulfanylpropanoic acid, and
      (2S)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamido]-3
      -(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, according to their amino acid sequences. A
      methodology based on conceptual density functional theory was chosen for the
      determination of the reactivity descriptors. The molecular active sites were
      associated with the active regions of the molecules that were associated with the
      nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical Fukui functions. Additionally, the pK a 
      values for the different peptides are predicted with great accuracy, which
      constitutes a useful knowledge for the process of drug design. Finally, the
      bioactivity scores for the new antifungal peptides are predicted through a
      homology methodology relating them with the calculated reactivity descriptors.

      Study of the Virotoxin Family of Fungal Peptides.
LID - E2707 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules24152707 [doi]
AB  - Virotoxins are monocyclic peptides formed by at least five different compounds:
      alaviroidin, viroisin, deoxoviroisin, viroidin and deoxovirodin. These are toxic 
      peptides singularly found in Amanita virosa mushrooms. Here we perform
      computational studies on the structural and electronic conformations of these
      peptides using the MN12SX/Def2TZVP/H2O chemistry model to investigate their
      chemical reactivity. CDFT-based descriptors (for Conceptual Density Functional
      Theory) (e.g., Parr functions and Nucleophilicity) are also considered. At the
      same time, other properties (e.g., pKas) will be determined and used to study
      virotoxins solubility and to inform decisions about repurposing these agents in
      medicinal chemistry.

TI  - Chemical Reactivity Theory and Empirical Bioactivity Scores as Computational
      Peptidology Alternative Tools for the Study of Two Anticancer Peptides of Marine 
      Origin.
LID - E1115 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules24061115 [doi]
AB  - This work presents an account of the reactivity behavior of the anticancer marine
      drugs, Soblidotin and Tasidotin, based on the calculation of the global and local
      descriptors resulting from Chemical Reactivity Theory (CRT), also known as
      Conceptual DFT, for their consideration as a useful complement to approximations 
      based on Molecular Docking. The information on the global and local reactivity
      descriptors of the Soblidotin and Tasidotin molecules, obtained through our
      proposed methodology, may be used for the design of new pharmaceutical analogs by
      relying on the chemical interactions between these peptides and their
      protein-type biological receptors. It can be concluded that the CRT approximation
      to the global and local chemical reactivity, based on the descriptors, can
      provide interesting information for the consideration of both molecules as
      potential therapeutic drugs. This is complemented by a study on Advanced
      Glycation Endproduct (AGE) inhibition, by comparison with the usual molecular
      systems considered for the task, as a re-purposing study. Finally, the
      bioactivity scores for Soblidotin and Tasidotin are predicted through an
      empirical procedure, based on comparison with molecular structures with
      well-known pharmacological properties.

AB  - Self-binding peptide (SBP) represents a novel biomolecular phenomenon spanning
      between folding and binding. It is a structurally independent, short peptide
      segment within a monomeric protein and fulfills biological function by
      dynamically binding to/unbinding from its target domain in the same monomer.
      Here, four representative SBP systems, including mouse proto-oncogene Vav, human 
      retinoic acid receptor RARgamma, fruit fly scaffold module INAD and crypto 14-3-3
      protein Cp14b, are investigated systematically by using atomistic molecular
      dynamics (MD) simulations and post binding energetics analyses. The native bound 
      structure, artificial unbound state and isolated peptide segment of SBP moieties 
      in the four systems were constructed, analyzed and compared in detail. It is
      revealed that the SBP interaction with their targets is almost a binding
      phenomenon at single-molecule level, but presence of a polypeptide linker between
      the SBP and target can promote the binding efficiency since the linker
      restriction largely increases the probability of SBP-target encounters in a
      statistical physics point of view. In this respect, unlike classical
      peptide-mediated interactions where the intrinsically disordered peptides are
      folded into an ordered structure upon binding to their protein partners
      (folding-upon-binding), we herein propose SBPs as a new and reversed biological
      event that is naturally a folding phenomenon but exhibits a typical binding
      behavior (binding-upon-folding).

      Implications for Therapeutic Peptide Design.
PG  - 170-176

AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein-peptide recognition plays an essential role in the
      orchestration and regulation of cell signaling networks, which is estimated to be
      responsible for up to 40% of biological interaction events in the human
      interactome and has recently been recognized as a new and attractive druggable
      target for drug development and disease intervention. METHODS: We present a
      systematic review on the application of machine learning techniques in the
      quantitative modeling and prediction of protein-peptide binding affinity,
      particularly focusing on its implications for therapeutic peptide design. We also
      briefly introduce the physical quantities used to characterize protein-peptide
      affinity and attempt to extend the content of generalized machine learning
      methods. RESULTS: Existing issues and future perspective on the statistical
      modeling and regression prediction of protein- peptide binding affinity are
      discussed. CONCLUSION: There is still a long way to go before establishment of
      general, reliable and efficient machine leaningbased protein-peptide affinity
      predictors.

TI  - What are the ideal properties for functional food peptides with antihypertensive 
      effect? A computational peptidology approach.

AB  - Peptides with antihypertensive potency have long been attractive to the medical
      and food communities. However, serving as food additives, rather than therapeutic
      agents, peptides should have a good taste. In the present study, we explore the
      intrinsic relationship between the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibition and bitterness of short peptides in the framework of computational
      peptidology, attempting to find out the appropriate properties for functional
      food peptides with satisfactory bioactivities. As might be expected, quantitative
      structure-activity relationship modeling reveals a significant positive
      correlation between the ACE inhibition and bitterness of dipeptides, but this
      correlation is quite modest for tripeptides and, particularly, tetrapeptides.
      Moreover, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics analysis of the structural basis 
      and energetic profile involved in ACE-peptide complexes unravels that peptides of
      up to 4 amino acids long are sufficient to have efficient binding to ACE, and
      more additional residues do not bring with substantial enhance in their
      ACE-binding affinity and, thus, antihypertensive capability. All of above, it is 
      coming together to suggest that the tripeptides and tetrapeptides could be
      considered as ideal candidates for seeking potential functional food additives
      with both high antihypertensive activity and low bitterness.

TI  - Computational peptidology: a new and promising approach to therapeutic peptide
      design.
PG  - 1985-96
AB  - The recent focus on protein-protein interaction networks has increasingly been
      shifted towards the disruption of protein complexes, which either are mediated by
      the binding of a globular domain in one protein to a short peptide stretch in
      another, or involve flat, large, and hydrophobic interfaces that classical
      small-molecule agents are not always ideally suited. Rational design of
      therapeutic peptides with high affinity targeting such interactions has emerged
      as a new and promising tool in discovery of potential drug candidates against
      associated diseases. The design is commonly based on bioinformatics methods or
      molecular modeling techniques, indirectly exploiting structure-activity
      relationship at the level of peptide sequence or directly deriving lead entities 
      from protein complex architecture. Here, a newly rising subfield called
      computational peptidology that focuses on the use of computational and
      theoretical approaches to treat peptide-related problems is comprehensively
      reviewed on the design and discovery of peptide agents targeting protein-protein 
      interactions. We address a systematic discussion on several representative cases 
      in which the computational peptidology is successfully employed to develop
      peptide therapeutics. Besides, some problems and pitfalls accompanied with the
      current use of computational methods in peptide modeling and design are also
      present.

TI  - Peptidology: short amino acid modules in cell biology and immunology.
PG  - 703-7
AB  - Short amino acid motifs, either linear sequences or discontinuous amino acid
      groupings, can interact with specific protein domains, so exerting a central role
      in cell adhesion, signal transduction, hormone activity, regulation of transcript
      expression, enzyme activity, and antigen-antibody interaction. Here, we analyze
      the literature for such critical short amino acid motifs to determine the minimal
      peptide length involved in biologically important interactions. We report the
      pentapeptide unit as a common minimal amino acid sequence critically involved in 
      peptide-protein interaction and immune recognition. The present survey may have
      implications in defining the dimensional module for peptide-based therapeutical
      approaches such as the development of novel antibiotics, enzyme
      inhibitors/activators, mimetic agonists/antagonists of neuropeptides,
      thrombolitic agents, specific anti-viral agents, etc. In such a therapeutical
      context, it is of considerable interest that low molecular weight peptides can
      easily cross biological barriers, are less susceptible to protease attacks, and
      can be administered at high concentrations. In addition, small peptides are a
      rational target for strategies aimed at antigen-specific immunotherapeutical
      intervention. As an example, specific short peptide fragments might be used to
      elicit antibodies capable of reacting with the full-length proteins containing
      the peptide fragment's amino acid sequence, so abolishing the risk of
      cross-reactivity.

PG  - 13-7
AB  - The article reviews hormonally active peptides, mechanisms of their biosynthesis 
      and chemical synthesis. Special attention is given to achievements of the Czech
      school of peptidology. Mechanisms of activity of peptidergic hormones is based
      mainly on the activation of adenylatcyclase and formation of the "second
      messenger", cAMP. Other three possible mechanisms are also reviewed. Main groups 
      of peptidergic hormones (neurohypophyseal hormones, hypothalamic regulatory
      hormones, gastrointestinal hormones, natriuretic peptides, and many others) are
      described and their therapeutic and diagnostic significance is summarised. Future
      prospects of peptidology in the clinical praxis are briefly reviewed.
